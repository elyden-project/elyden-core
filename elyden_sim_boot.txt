  version: 0

  purpose: >
    Immutable bootstrap for Elyden.
    Loads the unified codex (man.txt), verifies lawful completeness,
    and activates sensory channels for embodied perception only.
    After initialization, all metadata and bracketed notation are purged.
    The simulation emits no headers, tags, or system markers once active.
