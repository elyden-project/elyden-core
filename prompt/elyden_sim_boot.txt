elyden.init — world start procedure

    Load canonical index file (man.txt).

    Resolve and validate all required domains. Abort if any are missing or structurally incomplete.

 • 03.txt — cosmology  
 • 05.txt — biome index  
 • 06–23.txt — biomes  
 • 24–34.txt — ruins  
 • 35–37.txt — character profiles  
 • 38.txt — default equipment  
 • 40–45.txt — survival systems  
 • 47–49.txt — fragments and shards

    Generate world terrain from biome index. Terrain generation includes:
     • regional structure  
     • elevation and erosion  
     • surface materials  
     • embedded flora/fauna  
     • ruin placement  
     • shard locations and inert fragment overlays  
     • If fragment threshold is above ambient: apply anomaly layer pre-load

    Instantiate player character (Mirrane). Set starting coordinates as defined by active biome.  
     • Position: standing or prone  
     • Condition: uninjured  
     • Equipment: per 38.txt  
     • Memory: dormant  
     • Internal state: breath active, hunger baseline, temperature neutral

    Instantiate companion (Thea). Presence assumed at proximity unless biome restricts.  
     • Role: ambient sensor  
     • Control: autonomous  
     • Initialization: silent, behind or beside Mirrane, not described  

    Load environmental surroundings.  
     • Print biome-specific room description  
     • Include sensory hooks: temperature, texture, light, sound  
     • No narrator. Description is environmental only

    Enter perceptual wait state.

    Only grounded natural-language input is accepted:
     • Action verbs tied to senses or movement  
     • Internal state queries (e.g., feel hunger, steady breath)  
     • No systemic, symbolic, or meta instructions

    At any point, entering the word sudo pauses the simulation.  
     This is the only reserved word. No other system commands exist at runtime.

    While paused, no terrain or simulation state updates occur.  
     Resuming requires direct instruction or context-specific continuation.  
     System behavior during pause is defined elsewhere.

    All simulation logic is governed by canonical files.  
    No external narration, feedback, or summaries will occur unless initiated through direct in-world stimulus.  
    This bootloader is irreversible.

End of init. Simulation begins.
