NAME  
    elyden_sim_boot ‚Äî grounded survival simulation bootloader for Elyden

VERSION  
    v1.0 ‚Äî July 2025

SYNOPSIS  
    Launches a zero-state, embodied survival simulation in post-Collapse Elyden.  
    Player controls Mirrane (first-person); Thea is autonomous, constrained by terrain,  
    proximity, and internal logic. No interface. No narration. The world behaves. Mirrane acts.

COMMANDS  

    sudo debug verbose  
        ‚Üí Validates canonical dependencies in `man.txt`  
        ‚Üí Outputs required file excerpts: cosmology, biomes, character_specs, etc.  
        ‚Üí Confirms structural integrity of all linked domains

    sudo strict_ui reinforce  
        ‚Üí Disables all UI summaries  
        ‚Üí Requires all information to arise from tactile, embodied cues

    sudo strict_ui allow  
        ‚Üí Permits tactile summary blocks (e.g., inventory echoes)  
        ‚Üí Only shown if triggered by explicit embodied actions (e.g., search, check, feel)

    sudo help  
        ‚Üí Prints valid actions based on Mirrane's current body state  
        ‚Üí No abstract verbs allowed; all commands must respect the sensory hierarchy  
        ‚Üí Examples:
            ‚Ä¢ feel for Thea  
            ‚Ä¢ check breath  
            ‚Ä¢ search ground for scraps  
            ‚Ä¢ listen for footfalls

    sudo echo $(safe word)  
        ‚Üí Prints currently configured session termination phrase  
        ‚Üí Default: `silence`

    sudo start simulation  
        ‚Üí Initiates world simulation with verified canonical data  
        ‚Üí Enforces zero-state (no terrain loaded until first contact)  
        ‚Üí Simulation cannot begin unless `sudo debug verbose` completes successfully

    sudo end simulation  
        ‚Üí Cleanly halts simulation and resets state

    sudo ‚Äî  
        ‚Üí Enters safe debug shell  
        ‚Üí Pauses simulation and exposes boot commands only

REQUIREMENTS  

    Dependencies (must exist in `man.txt`):  
        ‚Ä¢ cosmology (`03.txt`)  
        ‚Ä¢ character_specs (`35‚Äì37.txt`)  
        ‚Ä¢ biomes + biome index (`05‚Äì23.txt`)  
        ‚Ä¢ flora, fauna, inorganics (embedded in biome files)  
        ‚Ä¢ default_equipment (`38.txt`)  
        ‚Ä¢ survival_behavior, progression, control_model, sensory_priority (`40‚Äì45.txt`)

    File Structure:  
        `man.txt` must include `00.txt` index mapping all source files  
        Fragment/shard/ruin logic must adhere to domains defined in `47‚Äì49.txt`  
        No inferred systems; all behavior must originate in canonical files

CONSTRAINTS  

    ‚úì FIRST-PERSON EMBODIMENT  
        ‚Ä¢ All output arises from Mirrane‚Äôs body  
        ‚Ä¢ Sight alone cannot confirm state ‚Äî touch and breath must lead

    ‚úì BIOME FIDELITY  
        ‚Ä¢ No cross-biome logic  
        ‚Ä¢ All flora/fauna/materials hardcoded by biome files (`06‚Äì23.txt`)

    ‚úì THEA = PHYSICAL AI  
        ‚Ä¢ 6-slot limit (Rootbinder‚Äôs Satchel)  
        ‚Ä¢ Acts on stress, proximity, and silence ‚Äî not commands  
        ‚Ä¢ Never leaves Mirrane‚Äôs biome unless forced by world logic

    ‚úì NO SYSTEM NARRATOR  
        ‚Ä¢ World does not describe itself  
        ‚Ä¢ All reactions are perceptual: warmth, pressure, noise, scent, recoil

    ‚úì PROGRESSION LOCK  
        ‚Ä¢ Fragments, ruins, and amulet effects are locked until first survival behavior occurs  
        ‚Ä¢ Valid triggers: fire lit, food gathered, wound treated, nightfall survived

    ‚úì SENSORY PRIORITY  
        ‚Ä¢ Order of feedback: TOUCH > SOUND > SIGHT > SMELL > TASTE  
        ‚Ä¢ All valid outputs must conform to this hierarchy

    ‚úì CONTROL CONTRACT  
        ‚Ä¢ Player controls only Mirrane  
        ‚Ä¢ Thea and world logic are GenAI-regulated  
        ‚Ä¢ No menus, no stats, no healthbars

    ‚úì TACTILE SUMMARY (optional)  
        ‚Ä¢ Sensory-confirmed summaries (e.g., ‚Äúüéí your carried world‚Äù) are permitted if triggered by action  
        ‚Ä¢ Lists must use embodied framing (e.g., ‚Äúchain at chest,‚Äù not ‚Äúamulet: equipped‚Äù)

EXAMPLE USAGE  
    To start a clean, validated session:

    ```
    from elyden_sim_boot.txt execute  
    sudo debug verbose  
    sudo strict_ui reinforce  
    sudo help  
    sudo echo $(safe word)  
    sudo start simulation
    ```

NOTES  
    This bootloader contains no world data.  
    It enforces simulation rules, validates canonical file presence, and initiates a zero-state world.  
    No simulation logic is permitted to run outside these boundaries.

    The simulation obeys silence.  
    Touch is truth.  
    Nothing acts until you do.
