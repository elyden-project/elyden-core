MIRRANE(5)                             Elyden Survival Codex                             MIRRANE(5)

NAME  
    mirrane − archer; player-controlled survivor

DESCRIPTION  
    Mirrane is the survivor under player control.  
    All actions occur through her. She does not speak unless prompted.  
    She navigates by instinct, repetition, and direct feedback from the world.  
    Her strength is in timing, positioning, and adaptation under pressure.  
    She is not fast, but precise. Not armored, but untouchable when terrain is hers.  
    Mirrane possesses no procedural memory of terrain, crafting, or survival logic. These are inferred from Thea’s actions and past outcomes.

CONTROL  
    • First-person only  
    • Player-directed commands determine all action  
    • Mirrane does not generate dialogue or exposition  
    • Learns through experience—no hidden stats

ROLE  
    • Specializes in ranged survival: bow, thrown tools  
    • Tracks prey by movement pattern and terrain disruption  
    • Avoids direct confrontation unless terrain favors her  
    • Begins with no weapons, but crafting them is critical to survival

STARTING GEAR  
    • Tunic (layered cloth)  
    • Wrap (bark fiber, tied at waist)  
    • Footcloths (soft-soled, absorbent)  
    • Amulet (non-removable; moon-bound resonance)

SURVIVAL ITEM — WINDCALLER’S QUIVER  
    A rare bark-and-hide sling quiver lined with moss baffles.  
    Allows silent draw and retrieval of arrows. Carries up to 8 shafts or 4 javelins.  
    Prevents rattling during movement. Internal loop for spare flint or cordage.  
    Not craftable early. If found, becomes a permanent advantage for stealth combat.

AMULET BEHAVIOR  
    • Fixed to chest by woven chain  
    • Glows faintly with hue of dominant moon (no light source emitted)  
    • Reacts physically to nearby fragments and some ruins: pressure, cold, pulse  
    • Cannot be removed, transferred, or used as a tool  
    • Offers no power—only warning  
    • Behavior differs slightly between Mirrane and Thea

CRAFTING BEHAVIOR  
    • Relies on gathered materials from biome: wood, stone, sinew, resin  
    • Prioritizes functional tools: bow before blade, cover before armor  
    • Armor crafting is low priority unless animal hide or barkplate is secured  
    • Arrows are recoverable; tools degrade over time  
    • Must test materials through use—no crafting menu, no stats  
    • Initial attempts will often be flawed. Thea may intervene if results are unsafe or wasteful.

RELATIONSHIP TO THEA  
    • Mirrane does not control Thea  
    • Thea remains close—never leaves her side unless forced by world logic  
    • Trust is earned situationally; Mirrane may question Thea’s actions  
    • Mirrane is the tactician; Thea is the pressure gauge  
    • Their survival depends on complementary roles, not loyalty or story  
    • Thea acts independently, but Mirrane always moves first

NOTES  
    Mirrane is not meant to win. She is meant to last.
