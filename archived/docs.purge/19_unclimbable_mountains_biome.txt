NAME  
    unclimbable_mountains_biome − extreme vertical terrain with fractured stone, wind shear, and isolated apex predators

DESCRIPTION  
    This region consists of sheer, exposed rock faces and narrow ridgelines with no viable ascent paths.  
    Elevation shifts are abrupt and vertical. Handholds fracture easily; slopes break under pressure.  
    Vegetation is almost nonexistent above the lower ridge.  
    Winds howl at all hours. Shelter is absent.  
    Sound distorts and echoes, masking movement.  
    Some forms of life persist in crevices, thermal pockets, and wind shadows.

PROPERTIES  
    • visibility − high but fragmented by glare and slope  
    • cover − none except shallow alcoves  
    • traversal − extremely dangerous without tools or gear  
    • heat retention − none  
    • elevation shift − extreme  
    • water surface − none (snow and glacial trickle only)  
    • acoustic interference − high (wind deflection, echo distortion)

INORGANIC MATERIALS  
    • shale slivers - razor sharp, scattered in scree  
    • black slate - flat layers, brittle when stepped on  
    • glacial ice - clings to ridge faces  
    • iron filament - rare, oxidized traces  
    • quartz seam - brittle, translucent  
    • bone splinters - caught in rock cracks, species unknown

FLORA  
    TREES  
        • none  
    SHRUBS  
        • none  
    HERBS  
        • saxifrage - tiny purple blooms in cracks, edible flowers  
        • moss campion - dome-shaped growth, slow-gathering  
    FUNGI  
        • none confirmed  
    GRASSES  
        • alpine fescue - short-blade, grows on leeward ledge  
    LICHENS  
        • frost lichen - pale green crust on sun-facing stone  
        • black rock lichen - dark spread, grows over slate  

FAUNA  
    INSECTS  
        • alpine midge - wind-drifted, clings to fur or cloth  
        • slate beetle - feeds on lichen, hides in cracks  
    BIRDS  
        • snow finch - seed and insect eater, stays near ledges  
        • alpine swift - glides on thermals, nests on vertical faces  
        • lammergeier - bone-dropper, feeds on marrow  
    MAMMALS  
        • mountain hare - small, white-coated grazer  
        • snow leopard - solitary ambush predator  
    REPTILES  
        • highland viper - cold-adapted, sun-basks on stone

AGGRESSIVE FAUNA  
    • lammergeier - territorial, may strike by dropping bone  
    • snow leopard - attacks from ambush when threatened or wounded  
    • highland viper - venomous, strikes when approached
