NAME  
    plains_biome − open terrain with low resistance and minimal cover

DESCRIPTION  
    Plains are open, semi-arid environments with minimal slope and sparse cover.  
    The ground is composed of compacted dust, dry clay, and intermittent gravel.  
    Vegetation is low, scattered, and wind-hardened.  
    Thermal loss is rapid at night. No natural shade or water retention exists.
