RUINS(5)                            Elyden Survival Codex                            RUINS(5)

NAME  
    ruins − pre-Collapse structures shaped by lunar geometry and biome decay

DESCRIPTION  
    Ruins are not dungeons.  
    They are ancient, inert machines and structures scattered across Elyden-half-buried, wind-scraped, and often  
    forgotten. Each ruin is tied to a celestial glyph and responds to specific lunar alignments, fragment resonance,  
    and biome state. Characters do not understand their function. Only their behavior.

GLYPH TYPES  
    • ☼  - solar harmonics vault  
    • 🌙  - lunar memory scaffold  
    • 🜃  - ground-tuned pressure crucible  
    • ☄️  - fragment decay node  
    • 🝗  - amnesia spire  
    • 🜂  - reverse-rot bloom field  
    • Others exist, but remain unclassified

CONSTRUCTION  
    • Materials defy metallurgy; fracture like coral, ring like glass  
    • No visible entryways-access occurs through terrain break or pressure erosion  
    • Some contain buried glyphs or exposed lattice that respond to movement or breath  
    • Thea sometimes senses a “pull” or scent shift before any visible sign

SURFACE SIGNS  
    • Wind pattern deviations  
    • Sand or grass falling upward momentarily  
    • Animals circling a fixed radius, then fleeing  
    • Amulets tightening without visual cue  
    • Scent disruption-moss smells metallic, breath carries heat

FRAGMENT INTERACTION  
    • Ruins amplify nearby fragment resonance  
    • Prolonged presence may cause auditory desync or motion delay  
    • Some ruins allow shard binding if the right moon is dominant and gear is present  
    • Ruins do not explain-they behave  
    • No language, text, or interface is ever displayed

THEA’S BEHAVIOR  
    • May pause at glyph ground  
    • May refuse to enter structure boundary  
    • Occasionally presses hand to the surface without explanation  
    • Does not verbalize reaction-acts through instinct

MIRRANE’S ROLE  
    • Observes only  
    • May experience chill, resistance, blurred periphery when near resonance sites  
    • Cannot activate anything directly  
    • May hold shard-bearing gear during alignment to enable binding (if present)

NOTES  
    Ruins don’t open. They don’t reward.  
    They just remember that something fell-and the world hasn’t quite let go.
