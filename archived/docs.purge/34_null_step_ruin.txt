NAME  
    null_step_ruin − descending substructure carved into bedrock terminating in planar void

DESCRIPTION  
    A narrow stairway carved directly into solid stone, found in remote plateaus, badlands, or glacial margins.  
    The descent appears as a continuous, seamless shaft with no construction joints or visible tool marks.  
    Surface continues past measurable depth before terminating at a matte-black plane.  
    There is no visible threshold, door, or end wall — only a geometric boundary beyond which visibility ceases.  
    Entrance is typically free of overgrowth, sediment, or wind-blown accumulation.

STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES  
    • shape: linear stair descent, fixed width  
    • termination: black planar boundary, depth varies  
    • material: identical to surrounding bedrock, unsegmented  
    • gradient: consistent shallow slope without irregularity  
    • location: high elevation outcrops, erosion-resistant zones

SURFACE TRAITS  
    • rim and entrance remain exposed regardless of climate  
    • small debris gathers at perimeter but halts before threshold  
    • no animal activity or tracks within entrance zone  
    • light diffusion bends slightly inward at step line  
    • acoustic return inconsistent near opening

INTERIOR FEATURES  
    • air temperature and dryness increase after initial descent  
    • no wind, noise, or dust recorded past third landing  
    • step surfaces remain free of residue under all conditions  
    • sound fidelity increases but spatial alignment distorts  
    • lower threshold does not reflect or emit light

MATERIAL STABILITY  
    • stone resists all percussion and cutting attempts  
    • tool contact results in dulling or material loss  
    • thermal exposure causes no discoloration or expansion  
    • organic materials show no degradation or reaction  
    • boundary remains optically opaque under all wavelengths

NOTES  
    No geological process explains the precision or depth of the descent.  
    No measurable end point has been confirmed below visual boundary.  
    Stair alignment and dimensions remain constant across known sites.  
    Structure does not match any ruin classification but is retained for index completeness.
