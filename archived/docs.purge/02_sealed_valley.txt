NAME  
    sealed_valley − the last survivable region in elyden

DESCRIPTION  
    The sealed valley is a tectonically isolated zone formed after the loss of Vaeronth.  
    The remaining moons generated sufficient force to raise volcanic ridges around a  
    temperate land basin. This perimeter is stable and defines the bounds of viable life.  

    Outside the ridges: sustained glacial overrun, cryogenic wind, and inactive biosystems.  
    Inside: disrupted seasonal flow, partial ecosystem retention, and fragmented weather loops.

    The valley is not monitored. It is not maintained.  
    It is the only remaining region where structures, growth, and active motion persist.

    No external paths remain. No crossings are confirmed.  
    This region defines the upper limit of post-collapse survival.

NOTES  
    • Ridge perimeter is composed of cooled volcanic stone  
    • Active geothermal zones exist: steam fissures and subsurface lakes  
    • Local weather is unstable but non-lethal  
    • Environmental pressure is elevated; ecosystems are unstable

    • No ruins beyond the seal are accessible  
    • Surface beyond the valley is permafrosted and non-viable  
    • No recorded entry or exit has occurred since sealing
