NAME  
    mixed_forest_biome − transitional forest zone with coniferous and deciduous overlap

DESCRIPTION  
    Mixed forest contains both broadleaf and coniferous tree species, with seasonal canopy shifts.  
    Understory vegetation is dense, and forest floor is layered with needles, leaves, and moss.  
    Soil is moist and friable, with animal trails forming natural corridors.  
    Light patterns change by season, creating patchy clearings and shaded pockets.  
    Water is retained in shaded ruts, hollows, and beneath stone outcrops.

PROPERTIES  
    • visibility − moderate  
    • cover − high (dense vegetation, trunk overlap)  
    • traversal − moderately impeded (root tangles, slope)  
    • heat retention − moderate  
    • elevation shift − minor  
    • water surface − intermittent

INORGANIC MATERIALS  
    • leaf mold  
    • moist loam  
    • bark fiber  
    • sedimentary gravel  
    • sap pockets (from pine)
