NAME  
    fragments − inert remains of vaeronth embedded beneath the surface

DESCRIPTION  
    When Vaeronth lost cohesion, most of its mass remained in orbit,  
    forming a visible ring in the upper sky. A minority of material entered  
    atmosphere and embedded into deep crust layers - beneath stone, ice, or soil.  

    These fragments are inert.  
    They do not glow, emit, respond, or activate.  
    They cannot be shaped or extracted.  
    They are not affected by lunar cycles.

    Over extended exposure, certain apex lifeforms near buried mass  
    developed internal structures with arcane resonance.  
    These internalized materials are not fragments.  
    They are biologically formed shards.

NOTES  
    • Fragments cannot be seen, touched, collected, or transformed  
    • They have no reactive properties or surface presence  
    • Shard formation is a biological effect in megafauna  
    • The process is non-reversible and non-repeatable outside host tissue
