NAME  
    swamp_biome − wetland basin with anaerobic decay, shifting ground, and high biological density

DESCRIPTION  
    The swamp is a low-lying terrain where water collects in stagnant pools and root systems.  
    Ground is soft, frequently deceptive, and may collapse under pressure.  
    Air is humid and oxygen-thin near the surface. Rot is present in every layer: fungal, vegetal, animal.  
    Light is filtered by haze and canopy, but ambient glow from certain fungi may appear at night.  
    Movement is slow and dangerous due to unstable footing and concealed predators.

PROPERTIES  
    • visibility − low (mist, canopy)  
    • cover − high (brush, waterline reeds)  
    • traversal − difficult and risky (sink, slip, entangle)  
    • heat retention − high (stagnant, wet)  
    • elevation shift − negligible  
    • water surface − pooled, non-circulating

INORGANIC MATERIALS  
    • peat - dense organic fuel, wet until cured  
    • bog clay - slick, deep, retains imprints  
    • sulfur flecks - may indicate toxic venting  
    • rootwood - twisted, unusable for burning  
    • black stone - stained mineral cluster  
    • reed ash - light, sterile

FLORA  
    TREES  
        • swamp willow - long, drooping branches  
        • cypress - wide base, rot-resistant wood  
        • alder - shallow root system, nitrogen-fixing  
    SHRUBS & VINES  
        • bush weed - feral cannabis, psychoactive when dried  
        • poison sumac - severe skin irritant  
        • bog creeper - vine-like, clings to ankles  
    HERBS  
        • bloodroot - red-staining rhizome, irritant  
        • mint - aromatic, repels insects  
        • marsh marigold - yellow flower, toxic raw  
    FUNGI  
        • ghost cap - glows faintly, inedible  
        • dead lichen - brittle, inert  
        • swamp puffball - spores trigger coughing  
        • cordyceps - parasitic, grows on insect corpses  
    AQUATIC PLANTS  
        • duckweed - floats in mats, edible in moderation  
        • cattail - fibrous, core edible  
        • bladderwort - carnivorous, traps small prey  
    GRASSES  
        • sedge - triangular stem, cuts skin  
        • marsh grass - dense, slippery footing

FAUNA  
    INSECTS  
        • mosquito - blood feeder, active at dusk  
        • leech - attaches below waterline, slow to remove  
        • marsh fly - lays eggs in rot, swarms at heat  
        • wasp - nests in reeds, aggressive if disturbed  
    AMPHIBIANS  
        • bullfrog - deep croak, consumes insects and hatchlings  
        • spotted salamander - moist-bodied, burrows under roots  
    REPTILES  
        • cottonmouth - venomous, floats while hunting  
        • snapping turtle - hides in silt, clamps hard  
        • water snake - fast swimmer, non-venomous  
        • anaconda - large constrictor, mimics log in water  
        • black caiman - apex ambush predator, rests submerged  
    BIRDS  
        • heron - long-legged fisher, nests in canopy  
        • rail - skittish ground walker, hard to flush  
        • bittern - freeze posture, camouflaged in reeds  
    MAMMALS  
        • swamp rat - aggressive scavenger, infests corpses  
        • otter - slippery predator, den in reed clusters  
        • wild boar - forages in muck, can become aggressive

AGGRESSIVE FAUNA  
    • wild boar - charges when cornered or surprised  
    • cottonmouth - venomous bite, strikes from water  
    • snapping turtle - clamps extremities if provoked  
    • leech - persistent blood drain if submerged  
    • wasp - swarms when nest is disturbed  
    • anaconda - strikes from shallows, constricts before dragging  
    • black caiman - strikes from waterline, drags prey silently
