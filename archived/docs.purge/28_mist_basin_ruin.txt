NAME  
    mist_basin_ruin − concave depression lined with fractured ceramic and persistent low vapor

DESCRIPTION  
    A circular basin formed by uneven stone collapse and subsidence.  
    The perimeter is edged with warped and partially buried ceramic tiling.  
    A dense cold vapor fills the interior and remains static in all conditions.  
    Narrow grooves in the rimstone continually collect condensation.  
    Internal features beneath the mist are partially submerged and visually unstable.

STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES  
    • shape: concave basin, circular edge  
    • diameter: 10–14 meters typical  
    • floor material: tile, sediment, vapor-filled hollows  
    • rim structure: stone and ceramic, fractured with shallow runnels  
    • elevation: lower than surrounding terrain by 1.5–2 meters

SURFACE TRAITS  
    • persistent ground moisture, unaffected by rainfall  
    • surrounding vegetation bends inward toward the basin  
    • rimstone produces tonal resonance when struck  
    • air contains suspended moisture but no particulate odor  
    • ambient noise level is reduced near basin center

INTERIOR FEATURES  
    • visibility limited beyond 5 meters due to static vapor  
    • submerged features include stone platforms, steps, and partial structures  
    • water channels are irregular and do not follow surface topology  
    • vapor temperature consistently below ambient air  
    • surface layers remain undisturbed under moderate foot traffic

MATERIAL STABILITY  
    • tile segments crack under lateral stress but resist vertical pressure  
    • water samples exhibit low organic content, high mineral saturation  
    • ceramic fragments show melting along inner curve edges  
    • basin walls maintain structural integrity despite erosion patterns

NOTES  
    No animal presence recorded in or near the structure.  
    Mist density and pool shape remain constant regardless of weather.  
    Survey attempts show mild compass drift near the center.  
    Underlayer architecture remains partially obscured by sediment and depth.
