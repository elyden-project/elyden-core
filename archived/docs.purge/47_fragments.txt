FRAGMENTS(5)                        Elyden Survival Codex                        FRAGMENTS(5)

NAME  
    fragments − lunar remnants embedded in ruins, terrain, or apex lifeforms

DESCRIPTION  
    Fragments are physical shards of Vaeronth, the collapsed moon of logic and magic.  
    They fell during the Collapse and embedded themselves into Elyden’s terrain, structures,  
    and, in rare cases, living bodies.  
    They are not mystical. They do not glow.  
    They exert subtle distortions on matter, memory, pressure, and environment.

CLASSIFICATION  
    • Ruin-bound       - embedded in ancient structures; dormant but reactive  
    • Biome-submerged  - buried in terrain; occasionally surface-exposed after erosion  
    • Host-grown       - absorbed over generations by shard-tier fauna; found only after death

BEHAVIOR  
    • Fragments warp local conditions:  
        − Light echo, pressure bloom, tremor repeat  
        − Sound softening or delay  
        − Shift in amulet sensation (tightness, chill, pulse)  
    • No heat, glow, or sound of their own  
    • Do not activate-only respond to lunar alignment, ruin geometry, or presence of life

DETECTION  
    • Amulets react under proximity and lunar weight  
    • Environmental clues:  
        − Asymmetrical moss growth  
        − Water ripple offset  
        − Scent distortion or nausea  
    • Fragments cannot be extracted by tools unless already exposed

DANGER  
    • Extended exposure may affect cognition-short-term disorientation, perception lag  
    • Cannot be handled safely without containment or ruin-aligned materials  
    • Animals avoid fragment soil unless diseased or driven

RELATION TO SHARDS  
    • Shards are not fragments-they are biological crystalized growths derived from absorbed fragments  
    • Only megafauna that survive long-term exposure develop shard cores  
    • Killing such a creature is the only known way to extract a usable shard

NOTES  
    Fragments are not magical. They are what remains of something that broke wrong and never stopped humming.  
    They are not for the player. They are for the world.
