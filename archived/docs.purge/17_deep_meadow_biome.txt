NAME  
    deep_meadow_biome − dense, entangling overgrowth with poor visibility and acoustic distortion

DESCRIPTION  
    Deep meadows are the result of long-overgrown grasslands left undisturbed for years.  
    The terrain is fully exposed to light but visually enclosed by height: waist-deep to shoulder-high flora.  
    Movement is slowed, and visibility is minimal. Sound is swallowed by the density, causing echo loss.  
    Dry patches are highly flammable. Slopes may hide hollows or sudden dips.  
    Wind is the only consistent movement visible at distance.

PROPERTIES  
    • visibility − poor (dense horizontal foliage)  
    • cover − high (grass, reed, low shrubs)  
    • traversal − moderate (snag, sink, slow)  
    • heat retention − low at night, high during still days  
    • elevation shift − minor, but hidden  
    • water surface − absent, dew only  
    • ignition risk − high (dry leaf layer)

INORGANIC MATERIALS  
    • dried clay  
    • packed dust  
    • stone scatter  
    • flint shard  
    • scorched root bundles  
    • old ash pockets

FLORA  
    GRASSES  
        • wild rye - tall, dry blades  
        • brome - seed-heavy, golden in sun  
        • bentgrass - forms mats, slippery when wet  
    HERBS  
        • yarrow - white blossom, used in salves  
        • burdock - hooks into clothing and fur  
        • plantain - grows in open spots, edible when boiled  
    FLOWERS  
        • bluebell - bell-shaped, clustered bloom  
        • goldenrod - late-summer bloom, attracts insects  
        • thistle - spiny, purple-topped  
    SHRUBS  
        • bramble - thorned, spreads under canopy  
        • hawthorn - low, berry-producing  
        • rose - thorny climber, grows in rings

FAUNA  
    INSECTS  
        • deer tick - blood-seeking, clings to tall grass  
        • grasshopper - sound-producing, evasive  
        • horsefly - diurnal biter, fast-moving  
        • ground beetle - scavenger, active at night  
    REPTILES & AMPHIBIANS  
        • slow worm - burrows under dry root piles  
        • toad - insectivore, active at dusk  
    BIRDS  
        • skylark - hovers in wind currents, sings in flight  
        • pheasant - ground forager, startles easily  
        • crow - scavenger, follows disturbed zones  
    MAMMALS  
        • hare - agile runner, hidden in grass nests  
        • polecat - solitary scavenger, follows scent trails  
        • field mouse - quick, gathers seed  
        • fox - hunts in arcs, low to ground  
        • boar - heavy forager, pushes through dense grass

AGGRESSIVE FAUNA  
    • fox - may attack if sick or wounded  
    • boar - charges if startled, tears paths through cover  
    • horsefly - bites persistently in open sun  
    • deer tick - latches and feeds slowly, difficult to detect
