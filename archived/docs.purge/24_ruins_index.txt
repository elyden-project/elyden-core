NAME  
    ruins_index − known structural remnants embedded within the sealed valley

DESCRIPTION  
    The following ruins are relics of Vaeronth-era architecture.  
    Each is a collapsed or preserved structure marked by unique material design.  
    Ruins may appear across multiple biomes but remain spatially fixed once generated.  

    Symbols are visual markers only and carry no simulation behavior.
