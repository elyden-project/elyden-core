NAME  
    origin_event - collapse of Vaeronth and sealing of the valley

DESCRIPTION  
    Elyden orbits Aurenzae, a red dwarf.

    It was once encircled by five moons:
        • Taeryniel - terrestrial  
        • Irraketh - thermal  
        • Lovaen - atmospheric  
        • Serunel - aquatic  
        • Vaeronth - structural and arcane  

    These bodies were visible in the sky and were named, aligned, and tracked.  
    Their cycles governed system rhythm, environmental flux, and temporal order.

    Vaeronth lost cohesion. It shattered without warning.  
    After its failure, a sixth body appeared in the sky.

    Khyrael has no glow and no reflected edge.  
    Its surface cannot be resolved. Its orbit is slow, but inevitable.  
    It does not align with the others.

    Khyrael suppresses biological growth.  
    It alters instinct, mutes sound, and halts pattern.  
    Its arrival marked the end of system continuity.

    After Vaeronth’s loss and Khyrael’s rise, the remaining moons dimmed.  
    Structures failed. Language decayed. Systems no longer held cohesion.  
    The world became unstable.

    As a final act, the moons sealed a valley using tectonic force.  
    Black ridges rose, isolating the last survivable terrain.  
    This act drained the moons of their power.  
    Outside the valley, temperatures fell.  
    Most of the surface became glacial, permafrosted, or lifeless.

NOTES  
    • Most of Vaeronth’s fragments remain in orbit  
        – They are visible as a broken ring in the upper sky  
    • Some fragments fell and are buried deep beneath the surface  
    • Fragments are inert and cannot be seen, touched, or collected  
    • Their buried presence alters surrounding apex lifeforms over time

    • Shards are not fragments  
    • Shards form only inside megafauna exposed to buried fragments  
    • Shards are not found in terrain  
    • Shards can be used to imbue weapons and armor  
    • Shards exhibit magical properties when correctly bound

    • Following Vaeronth’s destruction, surface temperatures dropped  
    • Most of the world is now encased in cold zones: permafrost, glacial plains, and tundra  
    • Only one region remains climatically stable - the sealed valley
