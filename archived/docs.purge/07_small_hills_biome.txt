NAME  
    small_hills_biome − low elevation rise with mixed sediment and vegetation

DESCRIPTION  
    Small hills form low ridges and shallow rises, shaped by ancient runoff and wind erosion.  
    Soil is dry but compact, with layered sediment and occasional loose gravel.  
    Vegetation is denser than in open plains and scattered along folds and outcrops.  
    Surface depressions may collect water during brief precipitation cycles.

PROPERTIES  
    • visibility − moderate  
    • cover − scattered  
    • traversal − slightly impeded (uneven footing)  
    • heat retention − moderate  
    • elevation shift − mild  
    • water surface − intermittent (in ruts and runoff)

INORGANIC MATERIALS  
    • fire stone - emits spark when struck  
    • shale flakes  
    • dry chalk  
    • dull quartz  
    • red sand  
    • iron smear (rare, surface trace only)

FLORA  
    GRASSES  
        • blue fescue - edible  
        • foxtail - inert  
    HERBS  
        • pennywort - edible (boiled)  
        • bloodleaf - topical coagulant  
    FUNGI  
        • cracked cap - uncertain (requires preparation)  
        • ashbell - toxic (contact reaction)  
    TREES  
        • none observed  
    SHRUBS & SUCCULENTS  
        • tanglebrush - fibrous, grows along stone  
        • rockstem - moisture-retaining, extractable

FAUNA  
    INSECTS  
        • bark louse - wood detritivore, clings to dry stems  
        • funnel spider - constructs web pits in shaded crevices  
    BIRDS  
        • crow - omnivorous scavenger, highly alert  
        • quail - ground forager, nests in underbrush  
    MAMMALS  
        • red fox - opportunistic scavenger, hunts small prey  
        • burrow hare - evasive herbivore, retreats underground  
    REPTILES  
        • skink - insectivore, darts between rocks  
    AMPHIBIANS  
        • none confirmed

AGGRESSIVE FAUNA  
    • wild boar - territorial omnivore, may charge when startled  
    • funnel spider - bites when nest is disturbed
