NAME  
    deep_evergreen_forest_biome − overgrown, sunless terrain with high biological density

DESCRIPTION  
    This forest variant features layered coniferous canopy with minimal light penetration.  
    Soil is waterlogged, root-bound, and uneven. Fallen trunks create natural walls and crossings.  
    Moss, fungal mats, and thick leaf rot cover most surfaces.  
    Movement is slowed by obstacles and near-constant moisture.

PROPERTIES  
    • visibility − very low  
    • cover − near total (trunks, moss, underbrush)  
    • traversal − difficult (rot, slope, dense debris)  
    • heat retention − high (ambient insulation)  
    • elevation shift − variable (root rises, hollow pits)  
    • water surface − pooled (non-flowing)

INORGANIC MATERIALS  
    • rotted bark  
    • decomposed pine mulch  
    • sapstone  
    • clay silt (deep layer)  
    • root-anchored stone  
    • standing water (stagnant)

FLORA  
    TREES  
        • pine - dominant, old growth  
        • spruce - mid-rise, fallen trunks common  
        • fir - low canopy, clustered  
    SHRUBS & SUCCULENTS  
        • tanglebriar - thorny, climbs over fallen trunks  
        • marshleaf - edible when cooked  
    HERBS  
        • seepwort - grows near standing water, mild purgative  
        • ghostroot - pale stalk, inert  
    GRASSES  
        • none observed  
    FUNGI  
        • spongecap - edible, spongy texture  
        • corpse lichen - grows on bark, causes rash  
        • veil fungus - obstructs airways if burned  
        • hollowcap - bitter, inedible

FAUNA  
    INSECTS  
        • rotfly - breeds in decay, swarms over carrion  
        • gnat - blood-seeking, swarms in moist air  
        • wood borer - tunneler, weakens dead trees  
    BIRDS  
        • wren - ground forager, active at dawn  
        • crow - scavenger, nests in high branches  
    MAMMALS  
        • black bear - omnivore, active during dusk  
        • elk - migratory grazer, avoids confrontation  
        • gray wolf - hunts in coordinated groups  
    REPTILES  
        • fern snake - camouflaged, non-aggressive  
    AMPHIBIANS  
        • toad - mildly toxic, hides under moss

AGGRESSIVE FAUNA  
    • black bear - will charge when surprised  
    • gray wolf - pack hunter, responds to blood scent  
    • gnat - bites repeatedly when swarming  
    • toad - secretes toxin on skin contact
