NAME  
    veil_engine_ruin − radial stone-and-alloy spire formation with spiral wind-channel geometry

DESCRIPTION  
    A formation of thin tapering spires arranged in a spiral or arc pattern.  
    Each spire is constructed of a pale porous stone alloyed with white-gold material.  
    Hollow inlets run through their cores, aligned to prevailing wind corridors.  
    The terrain surrounding the structure exhibits curved wind paths and minor vegetation distortion.  
    No toppling spires have been recorded despite sharp lean angles and fractured tips.

STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES  
    • formation type: spiral spire array  
    • height range: 2–7 meters  
    • material: porous limestone composite with metal trace banding  
    • inlet design: ridged vertical bore, variable diameter  
    • base alignment: irregular but radially consistent

SURFACE TRAITS  
    • dust movement follows non-linear swirling trails  
    • fine white residue accumulates around spire bases  
    • surrounding flora bends away from central spiral axis  
    • ambient wind pitch alters while moving through arc  
    • nesting, waste, and animal activity are absent within known range

INTERIOR FEATURES  
    • core inlets remain clear of obstruction regardless of wind speed  
    • sound dampening observed within central spiral area  
    • reflected echoes within spires are layered and directionally inconsistent  
    • small displaced objects found collected near spiral center  
    • soil beneath spiral structure is dry and unusually compacted

MATERIAL STABILITY  
    • broken tip segments found within spiral perimeter  
    • exposed alloy striations resist corrosion  
    • porous stone softens in moisture but hardens when dry  
    • overall structure remains upright despite erosion and wind loading

NOTES  
    Wind behavior through the structure is variable but non-cyclic.  
    Acoustic anomalies are consistent across all recorded spiral instances.  
    No biological colonization recorded inside structural bounds.  
    Orientation remains constant across known field sites regardless of terrain grade.
