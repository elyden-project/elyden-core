NAME  
    ice_biome − exposed frozen flats with refraction, ice bloom, and low biomass

DESCRIPTION  
    This biome consists of frozen, wind-polished terrain formed from thick surface ice and compacted snow.  
    Daylight scatters across uneven crust, causing glare and visual distortion.  
    Meltwater appears briefly near dark stone pockets or midday sun angles.  
    No soil or rooted plants exist here.  
    Limited biological activity is possible: microalgae, migrating scavengers, or ground-resting birds.  
    Movement is flat but slowed by traction loss. Food and heat are minimal but not absent.

PROPERTIES  
    • visibility − high but distorted (glare, refraction)  
    • cover − none  
    • traversal − flat but slippery  
    • heat retention − none  
    • elevation shift − low (ridges only)  
    • water surface − frozen; melt pools near stone  
    • survivability − extremely low, but not null

INORGANIC MATERIALS  
    • clear ice - fractured with light veins  
    • black stone - retains midday heat  
    • dry frost - brittle and wind-blown  
    • layered crust - thin, can conceal dips  
    • reflective salt flecks - surface scatter  
    • trapped air pocket - shallow and cold, brief shelter

FLORA  
    TREES  
        • none  
    SHRUBS  
        • none  
    HERBS  
        • none  
    FUNGI  
        • none  
    GRASSES  
        • none  
    MICROFLORA  
        • snow algae - red or green bloom on sun-facing ice

FAUNA  
    INSECTS  
        • glacier midge - present in melt periods, swarms in warmth  
    BIRDS  
        • snow petrel - lands on black stone, feeds on windblown carrion  
    MAMMALS  
        • arctic fox - solitary scavenger, crosses between ridges  
        • ermine - weasel form, active during melt season

AGGRESSIVE FAUNA  
    • glacier midge - bites exposed skin in numbers  
    • arctic fox - attacks if cornered, usually flees
