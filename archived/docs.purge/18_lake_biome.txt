NAME  
    lake_biome − freshwater basin with geothermal influence and stable seasonal margins

DESCRIPTION  
    The lake is a wide, still freshwater body encircled by stable landforms.  
    Shorelines vary from gently sloped sand to clay inlets and reed beds.  
    The water remains clear, lightly warmed by geothermal activity.  
    Morning steam may form; air is calm.  
    The biome supports aquatic and shoreline life at high density.  
    Nights stay temperate near the edge. Movement across water is slow and silent.

PROPERTIES  
    • visibility − open from surface, obscured in depth  
    • cover − low at center, moderate near reeds and banks  
    • traversal − easy along edge; swimming required beyond drop-off  
    • heat retention − moderate due to geothermal influence  
    • elevation shift − none  
    • water surface − constant, gentle current near inflow/outflow

INORGANIC MATERIALS  
    • rounded stones — smooth, retain heat  
    • warm sand — dries quickly, soft underfoot  
    • clay pockets — usable for vessels, sealant  
    • obsidian-like flakes — sharp, brittle, rare  
    • clean gravel — filters well, scattered along inlets

FLORA  
    AQUATIC PLANTS  
        • waterweed — edible, anchored near rocks  
        • lake lily — floating leaves, edible root  
        • duck moss — grows on submerged logs, traps insects  
        • algae — threadlike, inedible, compostable  
    SHORELINE PLANTS  
        • duck potato — starchy root, found in mud  
        • marsh mint — aromatic, repels insects  
        • broad sedge — long fibers, used for matting  
    TREES  
        • aspen — tall, flexible, light-shaded bark  
        • birch — bark strips easily, burns well  
        • cottonwood — wide canopy, drops down for insulation  
        • alder — grows at waterline, root-stabilizing  
    FUNGI  
        • shelf mushroom — fans out on wood, firm when fresh  
        • cupped sponge — edible when young  
        • dew cap — appears on wet logs, water-retaining

FAUNA  
    INSECTS  
        • mayflies — swarm in cycles, edible in clusters  
        • lake midges — harmless, form dusk clouds  
        • water beetles — cling to pads, edible but bitter  
    FISH  
        • lake trout — deep-dweller, high fat content  
        • pike — aggressive hunter, especially in spring  
        • perch — school in shallows, easy to net  
        • eel — hides in rocks near warm vents, slippery  
        • catfish — bottom-feeder, thick-skinned  
        • carp — mud feeder, tough but abundant  
    AMPHIBIANS & REPTILES  
        • water snake — fast, non-venomous swimmer  
        • giant salamander — sluggish, near geothermal springs  
        • snapping turtle — submerged ambush predator  
    BIRDS  
        • grebe — agile diver, nests at reed edge  
        • heron — still hunter, feeds alone  
        • loon — calls across water, dives for fish  
        • wood duck — nests in hollows, skittish on foot  
    MAMMALS  
        • lake otter — social, known to raid camps  
        • deer — approach at dusk to drink  
        • marsh hare — grazes at sunrise near shore

AGGRESSIVE FAUNA  
    • pike — may attack smaller prey or fingers during spawning  
    • snapping turtle — clamps from cover near bottom  
    • lake otter — may bite if threatened or cornered
