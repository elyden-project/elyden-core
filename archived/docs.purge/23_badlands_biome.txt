NAME  
    badlands_biome − sun-blasted stone terrain with high erosion, no canopy, and lethal exposure

DESCRIPTION  
    The badlands are a cracked, overbaked landscape formed from ancient seabeds and fossil uplifts.  
    Soil is dry, flaked, and sterile. Wind scours exposed stone into grooves and hollows.  
    Water does not collect here; it evaporates or vanishes underground.  
    Vegetation is skeletal, brittle, and rare.  
    Animal life is sparse and adapted - low, armored, venomous, or scavenging.  
    No permanent shelter exists. Movement is unimpeded but exhausting.

PROPERTIES  
    • visibility − full, no obstructions  
    • cover − minimal (boulders and erosion shelves)  
    • traversal − dry and open, risk of collapse in loose zones  
    • heat retention − extreme (stone radiates at night)  
    • elevation shift − shallow rises, scattered drop-offs  
    • water surface − absent (flash evaporation)  
    • survivability − low, but not null

INORGANIC MATERIALS  
    • clay pan - hardened surface, may crack under weight  
    • chalk dust - coats surfaces, causes drymouth  
    • silica shards - brittle glassy flakes  
    • rust stone - high iron content, stains gear  
    • bleached bone - scattered, sun-flaked  
    • fossil tile - hardened plate, unyielding

FLORA  
    TREES  
        • none  
    SHRUBS  
        • saltbush - silver-leaved, water-retaining  
        • spiny broom - stiff, thorned  
        • desert tamarisk - sparse leaf, deep-rooted  
    HERBS  
        • wormleaf - pale and fibrous, edible if boiled  
        • drought sage - bitter, used to mask scent  
    FUNGI  
        • none observed  
    GRASSES  
        • stoneblade - cuts skin, dry stalk  
        • embergrass - curls when burned, stores heat

FAUNA  
    INSECTS  
        • dust wasp - burrows in clay, aggressive if disturbed  
        • bone beetle - scavenger, cleans remains  
        • fire ant - forms tight colonies under stone  
    REPTILES & AMPHIBIANS  
        • dust viper - heat-sensing ambusher, buried during day  
        • skink - fast, reflective skin, hides under slabs  
    BIRDS  
        • kite - circles overhead, waits for movement  
        • buzzard - scavenger, glides silently  
        • sand lark - calls at dawn, nests under stone  
    MAMMALS  
        • bloat rat - swells after water access, nests in cracks  
        • jackal - scavenger, works in pairs  
        • desert hare - lean runner, crepuscular

AGGRESSIVE FAUNA  
    • dust wasp - attacks when nest is disturbed  
    • dust viper - strikes when stepped on or shaded  
    • bloat rat - bites if cornered, seeks blood  
    • jackal - pursues lone prey at dusk  
    • fire ant - swarms when trail is broken
