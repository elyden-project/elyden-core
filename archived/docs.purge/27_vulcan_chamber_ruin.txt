NAME  
    vulcan_chamber_ruin − fused basalt ring structure surrounding sealed interior depression

DESCRIPTION  
    A ring-shaped formation located within exposed caldera depressions.  
    Outer crust is composed of vitrified basalt, cracked along concentric vent seams.  
    The inner section is fully enclosed, surface-melted, and resistant to excavation.  
    Residual ground heat persists year-round, with no visible geothermal output.  
    Entry is possible only through narrow fissures in the collapsed rim.

STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES  
    • configuration: circular basin, sealed center  
    • composition: fused basalt with layered flow banding  
    • inner material: vitrified, no identifiable stone boundaries  
    • diameter: 15–23 meters typical  
    • heat retention: high surface thermal inertia

SURFACE TRAITS  
    • stone radiates low dry heat regardless of season  
    • shimmer distortion observed in rising air columns  
    • terrain is bare; no vegetation, dust, or animal tracks  
    • airborne fauna avoid area overhead  
    • trace sulfur compounds detected at ground level

INTERIOR FEATURES  
    • internal access through crawl-width fissures at rim edge  
    • walls smooth and rounded; re-fused from molten state  
    • ambient airflow lacks vertical convection  
    • thermal vents silent, with no rhythmic pulse  
    • fine particulate matter absent from interior zone

MATERIAL STABILITY  
    • hairline fractures propagate under seismic stress  
    • central floor shows no reactive discoloration or erosion  
    • surfaces resistant to tool scoring or sample removal  
    • inner layer exhibits low conductivity and thermal transfer

NOTES  
    Subsurface origin unknown; no active magma source detected.  
    Identical structures observed at high and low elevation zones.  
    Ring symmetry and retention suggest engineered formation.  
    No measurable magnetic field anomalies recorded during survey.
