NAME  
    convergence_array_ruin − triangular obsidian lens formation embedded in low basin terrain

DESCRIPTION  
    A symmetrical three-point structure situated in shallow valleys or flattened plains.  
    Composed of three obsidian lenses, partially buried into separate mounds, aligned in an equilateral triangle.  
    Each lens is smooth, dark, and shows no etching, mounting, or supporting framework.  
    The region between lenses is bare and lacks plant growth, tracks, or acoustic return.  
    Subsurface voids are presumed beneath each lens but remain inaccessible under normal conditions.

STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES  
    • arrangement: equilateral triangle  
    • composition: frictionless obsidian lenses  
    • lens embedment: partial, no visible seam or anchoring  
    • region: low valley floors or collapsed hardpan  
    • spacing: uniform between all three points

SURFACE TRAITS  
    • surface wind patterns shift between lenses  
    • dust settles unevenly within triangle  
    • site lacks animal tracks or seed dispersal  
    • topsoil carries no echo return under impact  
    • small stones sometimes shift alignment on their own

INTERIOR FEATURES  
    • subsurface beneath lenses is stratified with sharp mineral layering  
    • central depression observed within triangular center  
    • lens surfaces reflect selectively, inconsistent with sky position  
    • no visible entrance or penetration into structural mass  
    • surrounding soil appears compressed without pressure source

MATERIAL STABILITY  
    • lenses resist fracture, impact, and thermal variation  
    • structure shows no response to contact or attempted marking  
    • no organic material adheres to lens surface  
    • exposed sections show no change across weather cycles

NOTES  
    The array is consistent in alignment across all documented instances.  
    Obsidian elements do not correspond to local geological types.  
    Center zone displays topological regularity without mechanical features.  
    Purpose and origin remain undetermined by field observation.
