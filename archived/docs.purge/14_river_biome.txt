NAME  
    river_biome − freshwater corridor with variable depth, sediment load, and riparian vegetation

DESCRIPTION  
    The river biome consists of flowing freshwater through varied terrain.  
    Banks are irregular, sometimes steep, sometimes eroded to muddy flats.  
    Water depth fluctuates by season and weather. Vegetation concentrates near banks, shallows, and midstream islands.  
    Animal activity is highest near water access points. Insect density increases at dusk and in still air.

PROPERTIES  
    • visibility − open near midstream, obscured by vegetation at banks  
    • cover − moderate (reeds, driftwood, overhang)  
    • traversal − difficult in water; soft banks risk slippage  
    • heat retention − low  
    • elevation shift − local drop near bends or falls  
    • water surface − constant, flow varies

INORGANIC MATERIALS  
    • smooth river stone  
    • silt and clay  
    • coarse gravel  
    • driftwood - light, brittle, waterlogged  
    • waterlogged bark - soft, strips easily  
    • fish scale residue - evidence of predation  
    • discarded shells - mostly freshwater mussel

FLORA  
    TREES  
        • willow - flexible branches, used for binding  
        • alder - prefers damp soil, small cones  
        • poplar - fast-growing, low canopy  
    SHRUBS  
        • dogwood - fibrous stems, grows in clusters  
        • elder - edible berries, toxic leaves  
        • gooseberry - fruit-bearing, thorned  
    HERBS  
        • watercress - edible, grows in shallow flow  
        • mint - aromatic, used to repel insects  
        • dock - large leaves, applied to irritation  
    FUNGI  
        • swamp puffball - spore-ejecting, not edible  
        • shelf fungus - grows on driftwood, edible when dried  
    AQUATIC PLANTS  
        • cattail - edible core, grows in dense stands  
        • reedmace - tall, fibrous, flammable head  
        • duckweed - floating mat, edible in small amounts  
    GRASSES  
        • reed canary grass - tall, grows in clusters  
        • wild sedge - spiny blades, near still water

FAUNA  
    INSECTS  
        • horsefly - day-active, bites exposed skin  
        • mosquito - dusk-swarming, blood feeder  
        • water strider - skims surface tension  
        • damselfly - hoverer, lays eggs in plants  
    FISH  
        • northern pike - ambush predator, hides in reeds  
        • trout - active swimmer, prefers cool eddies  
        • perch - bottom feeder, shelters near logs  
        • minnow - small, used as bait  
    AMPHIBIANS  
        • common frog - insectivore, emerges in rain  
        • marsh toad - hides in mud, calls at dusk  
    REPTILES  
        • grass snake - non-venomous, swims calmly  
        • snapping turtle - hides in silt, bites when stepped on  
    BIRDS  
        • heron - spear fisher, hunts in shallows  
        • kingfisher - dive-catcher, nests in banks  
        • mallard duck - surface grazer, flocking  
    MAMMALS  
        • otter - fish hunter, active at dawn  
        • water vole - burrows near roots, herbivore  
        • wild boar - forages along bank, may root through shrubs

AGGRESSIVE FAUNA  
    • wild boar - charges if surprised, very strong  
    • snapping turtle - strikes defensively from silt  
    • horsefly - persistent blood feeder
