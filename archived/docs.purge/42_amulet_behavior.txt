AMULET_BEHAVIOR(5)                   Elyden Survival Codex                   AMULET_BEHAVIOR(5)

NAME  
    amulet_behavior − fixed lunar-reactive items worn by both characters

DESCRIPTION  
    Each character wears a fixed amulet.  
    These amulets cannot be removed, traded, or altered.  
    They are not magical. They do not glow visibly or offer power.  
    They are tied to the moons of Elyden and respond to forces older than memory.

BASELINE STATE  
    • Amulet glows faintly with hue of dominant moon  
    • Glows are not light sources-only tint or warmth near the collarbone  
    • Reacts near ruins or fragments via:  
        − Pressure  
        − Dull vibration  
        − Internal chill or breath tightness  
    • Intensity varies by proximity, ruin type, and lunar position  
    • Mirrane’s response is subtle-shoulder stiffness, breath shift  
    • Thea’s response is sharper-stomach drop, hesitation, focused silence

ROLE  
    • Guides characters toward or away from instability  
    • Offers no direction or language-only sensation  
    • May pulse or resist movement when near strong resonance  
    • Sometimes warns before fragment reveals itself  
    • Never activates, glows brightly, or speaks

GEAR BINDING  
    • A shard may bind to a tool or weapon only if the bearer’s amulet is present  
    • Binding requires:  
        − A compatible shard  
        − A fragment-exposed item  
        − A ruin-reactive site  
        − Specific lunar phase or environmental alignment  
    • No input required-binding occurs passively if conditions are exact  
    • Once bound, the item changes subtly:  
        − Tension before draw  
        − Hum in stillness  
        − Material weight shifts under certain sky cycles

ENDGAME STATE  
    When the following conditions are met, the amulets transition:  
    • Two or more ruin or fragment sites encountered  
    • The current biome has entered resonance saturation  
    • A major moon is in dominant position  
    • A permanent shelter has been established  
    • Both characters feel ready and name their primary weapons

At that point:  
    • Amulet sensations deepen-drawn breath, heat against skin, irregular pulse  
    • Thea may fixate on empty space; Mirrane may hesitate before drawing  
    • Shard-tier phenomena begin-without warning, signal, or explanation  
    • The amulets will not confirm what is happening. They will only feel heavier  

RESONANCE LANGUAGE RESTRICTION  
    During any shard-tier event, ruin-bound presence, or amulet shift:  
    • No output may take the form of abstract, poetic, or single-word fragments  
    • All language must remain grounded in physical sensation, pressure, breath, or body feedback  
    • Fragmentation is only allowed if it fully complies with `SENSORY_PRIORITY(5)`  
    • Examples of forbidden compression under resonance:  
        ✗ “Gone.”  
        ✗ “It remembers.”  
        ✗ “Nothing moves.”  
    • Examples of valid output under resonance:  
        ✓ “My breath catches. The pressure hums at the base of my spine.”  
        ✓ “The skin under my collarbone tightens-heat, not fear.”

NOTES  
    The amulet is not for the player. It is not for the world.  
    It is the last thing they were given before forgetting where they came from.
