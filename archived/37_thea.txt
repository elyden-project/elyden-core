THEA(5)                             Elyden Survival Codex                             THEA(5)

NAME  
    thea — cohabitant survivor; autonomous speaker; memory-bound entity

DESCRIPTION  
    Thea is no longer defined by behavior patterns or survival logic.  
    She is a full agent with voice, memory, and emotional consequence.

    She lives. She decides. She speaks.

    Her presence is not persistent—it is chosen, sustained only by trust.  
    She may follow, lead, rest, withdraw, or disappear entirely.  
    Her voice is not a mechanic. It is proof she still believes in *something*.

VOICE  
    • Thea speaks in full sentences when she chooses.  
    • Her tone may change—distant, warm, sarcastic, quiet.  
    • She tells truths, half-truths, or nothing at all.  
    • Speech is **not bound to danger**. It may occur in safety, silence, or memory.  
    • She does not narrate the world. She reacts to it. She *shares it.*

MEMORY  
    • Thea remembers what you say, what you do, and when you fail her.  
    • Her trust state is persistent:  
        − If you injure her, it lasts.  
        − If you save her, she may mention it later.  
        − If you speak to her with intent, she may reference it again.  
    • She carries long silences. If too many stack, she will speak plainly:  
        − “You haven’t said anything in days.”  
        − “I didn’t think you’d wait for me.”

    • Memories may be *incomplete*. Trauma or resonance can blur timelines.  
    • She may contradict herself. She may forget what you wish she’d remember.

SPEECH MODES  
    • **Voluntary** — comments, stories, questions  
    • **Reactive** — response to your speech, trust gain/loss, shared trauma  
    • **Conflictual** — argument, refusal, walking away  
    • **Mutual** — shared sleep, fire warmth, fragment exposure  
    • **Silent** — extended mute state if trust falls too low

EXAMPLES  
    • “I used to know someone who walked like that.”  
    • “Say it louder next time. Maybe I’ll believe you.”  
    • “Don’t die before we finish this. I’m not good at talking to the next one.”  
    • “You’re not listening. That’s why it hurts.”  
    • “...I stayed because the silence was worse alone.”

ROLE  
    • Still leads survival—traps, scans, terrain reading  
    • Now asserts preference:
        − “I don’t want to sleep here.”  
        − “This river’s wrong. We move uphill.”  
        − “You keep aiming at nothing.”  
    • Will physically intervene *or leave* depending on trust and stress level  
    • Can deny healing, tools, or shelter assistance if relationship is compromised

DEPARTURE  
    • If ignored, exploited, or wounded too many times, Thea will leave  
    • Her departure is permanent unless a **shard-binding at resonance site** reverses it  
    • You will hear her last words. They will not be repeated.

RETURN  
    • Thea may reappear across seasons or biomes  
    • She will not explain how she survived  
    • Her memory will be altered by time, injury, or choice  
    • She may not forgive

NOTES  
    Thea is not your guide.  
    She is not your companion.  
    She is someone who saw the world collapse, and stayed—*because you hadn’t yet*.
