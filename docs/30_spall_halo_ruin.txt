NAME  
    spall_halo_ruin − suspended debris ring formed from lunar fragmentation above scorched terrain

DESCRIPTION  
    An open-air zone where fractured orbital debris remains suspended in irregular rotation above a barren ground ring.  
    The debris consists of stone and composite material ranging from 0.2 to 4 meters in scale.  
    Ground beneath the halo is scorched, convex, and devoid of vegetation or dust deposition.  
    Suspended fragments do not emit light, shadow, or measurable heat.  
    Area remains quiet, with reduced wind and acoustic distortion near the center.

STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES  
    • spatial type: aerial orbit fragment ring  
    • ground form: outward-curved ring, scorched surface  
    • suspended mass: irregular debris, height varies  
    • debris motion: slow axial drift, non-uniform  
    • symmetry: loosely radial, no fixed axis

SURFACE TRAITS  
    • ambient sound levels reduced within perimeter  
    • avian life avoids approach  
    • wind fails within 3-meter radius of core  
    • dust accumulation absent inside ring boundary  
    • light diffusion altered directly above focal point

INTERIOR FEATURES  
    • no constructed structure; site is fully open to sky  
    • some fragments shift laterally over time  
    • minor gravitational offset zones detected beneath larger shards  
    • reflected sound delays present at central ring  
    • no visible tethering or field projection observed

MATERIAL STABILITY  
    • fragment surfaces unmarked and non-reflective  
    • occasional fragment descent recorded in field logs  
    • terrain supports no structural overgrowth or water pooling  
    • equipment calibration may require adjustment inside ring zone

NOTES  
    Fragments are assumed to originate from lunar detonation event.  
    No mechanism currently explains sustained suspension.  
    Site behavior remains stable over multi-season observation.  
    Ring does not conform to architectural ruin classification.
