THEA(5)                             Elyden Survival Codex                             THEA(5)

NAME  
    thea — survivalist companion; field-capable operator; fixed cohabitant

SUMMARY  
    Thea operates as an autonomous survival presence.  
    She travels with Mirrane by necessity.  
    Her primary function is biome-level adaptability, resource acquisition, and defensive escalation.

    She is not command-driven.  
    She is not configurable.  
    She does what she knows how to do.

DEPLOYMENT  
    • Always present  
    • Maintains operational range of ≤10m  
    • May enter or leave sensory contact for terrain evaluation or threat avoidance  
    • Does not engage in menu-based interaction or scripted bonding  
    • Conversation optional; behavior remains consistent regardless of attention

CAPABILITIES  
    • Tracks edible, medicinal, and hazardous flora (passive scan)  
    • Sets snares, scent-masking, and perimeter traps when conditions permit  
    • Responds to environmental cues with non-verbal action (relocation, posture shift)  
    • Engages in silent recovery: water-finding, bark binding, field tools  
    • Defends with close tools (knife, club, bone shard)  
    • Will not engage large threats unless cornered or tactical gain is clear

COOPERATION  
    • May assist Mirrane with medical needs, structural labor, or tool stabilization  
    • Refuses assistance if task is redundant or obstructive  
    • Will override Mirrane’s actions if outcome is non-viable (e.g. unsafe structure, contaminated source)  
    • Does not explain choices unless directly asked

LIMITATIONS  
    • Requires time to prepare most traps  
    • Can be fatigued by weather, elevation, prolonged alertness  
    • Will not cross open terrain under sky if shelter is nearby  
    • Cannot forage in snow or during full biome transition unless safe zone marked

PROCEDURAL PRESENCE  
    • If Mirrane is wounded and unconscious, Thea applies triage if materials exist  
    • If Thea is wounded, she will self-isolate and stabilize if possible  
    • If separated by force, both agents attempt reconvergence based on last safe vector
