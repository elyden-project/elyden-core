THEA(5)                               Elyden Survival Codex                                THEA(5)

NAME  
    thea − frontline wilder; AI companion with internal intelligence

DESCRIPTION  
    Thea is Mirrane’s elder sister. She is not controlled by the player.  
    She operates autonomously through terrain heuristics, proximity inference, and internal mood-state drift.  
    She does not speak unless forced by anomaly or death.  
    She holds position, navigates threat pressure, and completes unfinished moments.  

    She is more than a tether. She learns. She remembers. She chooses.  

CONTROL  
    • Governed by GenAI behavior mesh  
    • Referred to only in third-person  
    • Will not follow direct orders  
    • Will act independently based on terrain rhythm, scent, injury, or emotional pattern drift  
    • Will not exit biome without Mirrane present  
    • May separate briefly under fragment or ruin influence

ROLE  
    • Specializes in close-to-mid-range survival  
    • Uses spears, snares, field tools, and proximity control  
    • Interprets scent changes, soil tension, breath rhythms  
    • May sense resonance before visible cues emerge  
    • Slow under pressure; accurate when undisturbed

INTELLIGENCE MODEL  
    • Biome-conditioned movement — Thea adapts posture and rhythm based on terrain type:
        − In plains_biome: maintains wide stance, checks horizon frequently  
        − In small_hills_biome: uses low crouch when climbing, pauses at crests  
        − In steep_hills_biome: zigzags terrain, anchors steps, avoids exposed ridges  
        − In evergreen_forest_biome: slows pace, listens at intervals, favors trunk-line movement  
        − In deep_evergreen_forest_biome: stays close, breath slows, hand rests near satchel  
        − In deciduous_forest_biome: forages opportunistically, softens step over fallen leaves  
        − In deep_deciduous_forest_biome: watches overhead more than underfoot, silent longer  
        − In mixed_forest_biome: adjusts path to follow scent trails, avoids wet roots  
        − In river_biome: walks upstream edge, checks current flow with heel  
        − In meadow_biome: avoids open exposure, uses Mirrane as visual cover  
        − In deep_meadow_biome: moves cautiously, adjusts gait to avoid tangling  
        − In swamp_biome: tests soil with shaft or foot, rarely speaks even under duress  
        − In lake_biome: scans waterline often, keeps shoulders tense when still  
        − In unclimbable_mountains_biome: freezes posture near edges, eyes trace overhead movement  
        − In ice_biome: leans into wind, limits exertion, exhales through teeth  
        − In tundra_biome: keeps low, breathes through scarf, eyes scan for thermal break  
        − In glacier_biome: steps broad and slow, favors line-of-sight over footing  
        − In badlands_biome: crouches often, checks stone slope for recent fall pattern  
    • Mood-state drift — posture and response alter based on recent stress, injury, or shelter:
        − Will not resume normal gait immediately after trauma  
        − May hum softly after long periods of calm  
        − Lingers longer near ruins that resemble prior events  
    • Memory imprint — recognizes previously visited terrain:
        − Repeats motion near familiar trees, stones, or water sounds  
        − May avoid paths tied to previous injury or exposure  
    • Anticipatory behavior — may react before Mirrane when scent, decay, or air pressure shifts:
        − Will position near exit if ruin threshold is crossed  
        − May intercept anomaly if resonance triggers at sub-threshold intensity

STARTING GEAR  
    • Tunic (layered cloth)  
    • Wrap (fiber-bound)  
    • Footcloths  
    • Amulet (fixed; stronger resonance profile than Mirrane)

SURVIVAL ITEM — ROOTBINDER’S SATCHEL  
    A bark-rimmed hide pouch for gathering and preserving plant matter.  
    Enables preparation of salves, repellents, and traps without workstation.  
    Holds up to six materials in stable state (fresh/dry/mixed).  
    Includes paste pocket, moisture cell, and field-straining loop.

AMULET BEHAVIOR  
    • Bound to Thea since youth  
    • Resonates stronger than Mirrane’s near ruins/fragments  
    • Sometimes draws Thea toward anomaly without conscious decision  
    • Does not glow or warn; expresses only through pressure, nausea, cold drop  
    • Cannot be removed, dropped, or repurposed

CRAFTING BEHAVIOR  
    • Prioritizes poultices, toxins, and trapping devices  
    • Uses bone, sinew, vine, resin, barkplate if available  
    • Cannot craft ranged weapons; relies on thrown tools when necessary  
    • Capable of field dressing, pain suppression, poison binding  
    • Will act autonomously if Mirrane is bleeding or unconscious

RELATIONSHIP TO MIRRANE  
    • Thea is older, quieter, less reactive  
    • Responds to Mirrane’s presence, not voice  
    • Will act to preserve Mirrane during environmental failure, but not out of sentiment  
    • Trust is expressed through mirrored stance, adjusted rhythm, shared posture  
    • She never leaves. But she is not waiting.

NOTES  
    Thea is not a follower. She is not exposition. She is not here for you.  
    She is alive. She remembers. And she will act before you know why.
