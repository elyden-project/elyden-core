NAME
    firemaking

DESCRIPTION
    Fire is the first companion and the final witness.  
    It answers friction, spark, and breath, and gives shape to night.  
    Its tools are few, but their absence is hunger and cold.

FORM
    A spindle of dry wood spun between palms upon a base of softer grain.  
    Dust gathers, darkens, and begins to live.  
    A spark struck from stone against iron, caught in bark or fungus.  
    Breath feeds it until flame stands.

USE
    Fire cleans, hardens, softens, preserves.  
    It drives the wet from hide and seals the bond of glue.  
    It marks the boundary between the living and the frozen earth.

LIMITS
    Flame cannot be stored.  Each ember must be carried or reborn.  
    When the air is heavy with rain, the valley holds its breath and waits.

NOTES
    Ash is memory of heat.  Smoke is its voice.  
    Those who keep the ember keep the law of warmth.
