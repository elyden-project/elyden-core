NAME
    repair

DESCRIPTION
    Repair is the act of refusal against loss.  
    It holds the line between usefulness and ruin.  
    Every mended thing carries the story of its breaking.

FORM
    Hide patch pressed warm and stitched across a tear.  
    Sinew thread drawn through old holes to tighten a loosened seam.  
    A split shaft joined by binding and sealed with resin.  
    A frayed cord twisted together until it hums with tension once more.

USE
    To extend the life of what labour made.  
    To keep edge, rope, and garment whole for another season.  
    Each repair is a conversation between wear and will.

LIMITS
    Nothing endures forever.  Every fix thins the material it saves.  
    Too much patchwork turns strength to weakness.

NOTES
    The wise repair early and often.  
    In the sealed valley, survival is measured in what is kept from falling apart.
