DESCRIPTION
    Tools are the extensions of hand and thought.  
    Each one exists to shape, divide, bind, carry, or mend the matter of the valley.  
    Their making follows the same law as their use: nothing hidden, nothing wasted.

FORM
    The simplest tool is born from contact between hard and soft.  
    Stone strikes wood, bone scrapes hide, cord draws tight around haft.  
    Fire seals what fingers cannot hold.

CATEGORIES
    firemaking     the work of heat and ember  
    cutting        the making of edges and their upkeep  
    binding        the joining of parts by cord, sinew, or glue  
    gathering      the carrying and keeping of food or fiber  
    repair         the restoration of what is frayed or broken  
    waterwork      the holding and warming of water without vessel

USE
    Tools allow survival to become repetition.  
    Through them, each act is remembered by the marks it leaves in wood and soil.

NOTES
    No tool stands apart from its maker.  Every handle shows the wear of its user.  
    When one breaks, the valley returns it to material and waits to be shaped again.
