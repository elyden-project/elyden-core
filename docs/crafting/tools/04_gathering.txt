NAME
    gathering

DESCRIPTION
    Gathering is the quiet labour between hunger and plenty.  
    It brings the valley’s small offerings into reach-seed, root, fiber, shell.  
    Its tools are baskets, wraps, and hooks shaped from what they seek to hold.

FORM
    A net of cord woven between pliant branches.  
    A basket frame bent from willow and lined with moss.  
    A hooked twig cut to pull fruit from high stems.  
    A reed mat folded and tied for drying herbs and grain.

USE
    For carrying food and fuel, for sorting stone and chaff,  
    for keeping harvest from damp soil and wind.  
    Every gatherer leaves a trace of order in the wild.

LIMITS
    Fiber loosens when soaked, bark splits under frost.  
    Each vessel must be emptied, dried, and shaped anew with the season.

NOTES
    The valley gives in fragments.  Gathering teaches how to piece them whole.  
    What is carried home becomes part of the hands that bore it.
