NAME
    cutting

DESCRIPTION
    Edges divide what the hand cannot.  
    They give order to hide and bone, to stalk and branch.  
    Every blade in the valley is born of fracture and pressure.

FORM
    A shard of glassy stone struck from a larger mass.  
    A rib ground thin against slate until it draws light along its edge.  
    A flake of bone or iron bound with wet sinew to a wooden grasp.  
    Heat and resin fix what time would loosen.

USE
    Skinning and carving.  Shaping shafts and clearing root.  
    Preparing food and mending camp.  
    A knife or scraper, each named only by its work.

LIMITS
    No edge endures without care.  Each dulls and must be renewed by hand.  
    A careless strike will break both stone and wrist.

NOTES
    The valley teaches patience through its edges.  
    A single flake, turned right, can feed a life.
