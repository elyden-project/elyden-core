NAME
    binding

DESCRIPTION
    Binding is the art of joining what would fall apart.  
    It turns fiber and tendon into memory of shape.  
    Through it, the tools of the valley hold together against strain and time.

FORM
    Strips of bark peeled thin and twisted while green.  
    Sinew drawn from fresh kill, washed, stretched, and dried in shadow.  
    Cord woven from grass or reed, sealed with tallow to resist the wet.  
    Resin warmed by ember and pressed between joined parts.

USE
    For hafting heads to shafts, for stitching hide, for setting traps,  
    for weaving nets, and for building walls of reed or branch.  
    Where the hand cannot hold, binding remains.

LIMITS
    Fibers weaken in water and rot if left unkept.  
    Sinew stiffens in frost.  Resin cracks when overfired.

NOTES
    Every bond is temporary.  The law of binding is vigilance.  
    What endures does so because it is remade.
