NAME
    waterwork

DESCRIPTION
    Water moves through every task of the valley.  
    To drink, to cleanse, to soften, to shape-it must be guided, held, and heated.  
    These are the means by which water becomes servant instead of master.

FORM
    A hollow pressed in clay and lined with ash, filled with stone and fire to boil.  
    A skin pouch greased with tallow, slung from cord to carry melt or rain.  
    Reeds bound tight to form a pipe, guiding stream into hand.  
    Clay crusts spread thin upon rock to gather dew at dawn.

USE
    For cooking and washing, for cooling meat, for sealing glue.  
    For every moment when warmth and cleanliness mean life.

LIMITS
    Clay splits if the flame climbs too fast.  Hide leaks when left in sun.  
    All vessels must be emptied and dried before night frost.

NOTES
    Water remembers its path.  It wears the makerâ€™s mark even as it fades away.  
    The patient learn from its silence how to endure.
