NAME
    spears

DESCRIPTION
    The spear is distance made solid.  
    It reaches where the hand dares not go and keeps what is near at bay.  
    Its point is the memory of the first hunt and the promise of the next.

FORM
    A long shaft carved from straight wood, smoothed by sand and fire.  
    Its tip shaped from stone, bone, or sharpened metal, fixed with sinew and resin.  
    Some bear crosspieces of horn to stop the thrust and save the wielder’s life.  
    Balance lies where grip and weight meet in calm accord.

USE
    For driving deep into flesh or soil, for walking the uneven ground.  
    In water it becomes a fisher’s fork; in forest, a silent companion.  
    The spear is patient, waiting for approach.

LIMITS
    Shafts warp when left against heat, heads loosen with rain.  
    Each must be checked by light and sound before use; the careless die by splinter.

NOTES
    The spear teaches reach and restraint.  
    Its virtue is not in the wound, but in the distance kept.
