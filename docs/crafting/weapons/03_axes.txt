NAME
    axes

DESCRIPTION
    The axe is the oldest argument between wood and stone.  
    It serves the hand that fells, shapes, and defends.  
    Its edge is both maker and destroyer within the valley.

FORM
    A wedge of slate or obsidian bound to a straight haft with sinew and resin.  
    Some heads are carved from bone or rare metal fallen from the sky.  
    The grip is wrapped in hide for steadiness and to drink the shock of impact.  
    Smoke from the first swing marks the tool as its own.

USE
    For cutting timber, breaking bone, and turning back the living when threatened.  
    For building, for clearing, for claiming warmth from tree and beast alike.  
    Each swing writes a measure of strength upon the air.

LIMITS
    Stone blunts quickly, resin loosens in heat, hafts crack when struck askew.  
    The axe demands attention after every task; neglect dulls more than use.

NOTES
    When sharpened at dawn, the axe speaks of intention.  
    Its dullness at dusk speaks of work completed.
