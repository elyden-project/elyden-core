DESCRIPTION
    Weapons are tools that carry intent beyond the reach of the hand.  
    They divide hunger from prey, threat from the living.  
    Each is made from the same earth and bone as its maker, and ends in the same dust.

FORM
    The shaping of weight, edge, and balance into a purpose.  
    Wood bent, stone set, cord drawn tight, bone sharpened.  
    No weapon in the valley is more than the meeting of these motions.

CATEGORIES
    bows       the curved wood that throws the arrowâ€™s flight  
    arrows     the small and silent messengers of distance  
    axes       the weight of hand given edge and swing  
    spears     the extension of arm and caution  
    clubs      the simplest balance of blow and grip  
    thrown     the brief flight of strength through air

USE
    For hunting, for defense, for the proof of survival.  
    Each strike feeds, protects, or ends; all obey the same law of return.

NOTES
    A weapon does not belong to the one who holds it.  
    It belongs to the moment when it is used.
