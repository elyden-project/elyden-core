NAME
    clubs

DESCRIPTION
    The club is the valleyâ€™s simplest weapon.  
    A length of wood held until it learns the path of the arm.  
    It speaks in impact, not in edge.

FORM
    A branch chosen for weight and grain, bark left for grip.  
    Some are shaped by fire, ends blackened and hardened.  
    Others are bound with stone or bone to carry more force.  
    No two are alike, yet all remember the hand that swings them.

USE
    For striking, for breaking, for warning.  
    A tool of defense when edge is gone, a hammer when camp is built.  
    It ends quarrels with the honesty of weight.

LIMITS
    Wood splits after long service, fibers crush under cold.  
    When cracked, the club must burn or be reborn from new branch.

NOTES
    The club knows nothing of distance or aim.  
    It trusts only in closeness and resolve.
