NAME
    bows

DESCRIPTION
    The bow stores the will of the hand and releases it as flight.  
    It joins wood, cord, and patience into a single motion of silence.  
    In the valley its sound is rare, a dry whisper across still air.

FORM
    A stave cut from yew or spruce, shaped by heat and scraped to balance.  
    The string twisted from sinew or grass and sealed with fat.  
    The grip wrapped in bark to keep the pulse from slipping.  
    When drawn, the arc holds breath and tension; when loosed, both are freed.

USE
    For hunting swift game across meadow or ridge.  
    For driving the arrowâ€™s point where foot cannot follow.  
    The bow teaches stillness before strength.

LIMITS
    Wood warps in rain and slackens in thaw.  
    Each cord frays and must be replaced by hand.  
    No bow endures neglect; it is a living limb bound to weather and care.

NOTES
    The sound of release is memory made air.  
    To string a bow is to borrow power and promise to return it.
