NAME
    arrows

DESCRIPTION
    Arrows are the valley’s quietest voice.  
    They travel where the body cannot, carrying hunger, warning, and resolve.  
    Each one is a brief alignment of feather, shaft, and edge.

FORM
    A straight reed or wand, dried and scraped smooth.  
    Its head chipped from stone or shaped from bone and bound with sinew.  
    Feathers fixed at the tail, turned by smoke to harden against damp.  
    Resin seals each joint, scent faint of pine and ash.

USE
    For taking bird and beast, for signaling across distance.  
    For moments when the bow’s memory must be carried farther.  
    The spent arrow is gathered if found, its flight remembered in silence.

LIMITS
    Shafts warp in frost, feathers loosen in rain.  
    Obsidian shatters on stone, bone dulls on hide.  
    Every arrow dies in service and is remade from what remains.

NOTES
    The path of an arrow is the shortest prayer.  
    It begins in breath and ends in stillness.
