NAME
    thrown weapons

DESCRIPTION
    Thrown weapons carry the strength of the body into air.  
    They bridge the space between hunter and hunted.  
    Each is a single motion cast outward, seeking rest in target or earth.

FORM
    A balanced stick curved or straight, hardened by flame.  
    Small stones shaped smooth by river and carried in hand.  
    Short spears with fire-blackened points, fitted for flight rather than thrust.  
    The art lies in release, not in ornament.

USE
    For hunting birds and hares, for driving beasts from thicket,  
    for signaling across distance when voice would betray.  
    The thrower learns the wind as kin, the arc as language.

LIMITS
    Wood swells in rain, shafts warp with time.  
    Stone strikes only once with purpose; after that it belongs to the ground.  
    No throw may be recalled once loosed.

NOTES
    The air remembers every cast.  
    Each throw is a brief surrender to gravity and chance.
