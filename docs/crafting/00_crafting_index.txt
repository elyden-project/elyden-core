NAME
    crafting index

DESCRIPTION
    The record of all lawful making within the sealed valley.  
    Crafting is the shaping of matter by hand and patience.  
    It binds the two survivors to the valley through work and endurance.  

FORM
    All forms arise from visible matter.  Each cut, knot, and join must be seen.  
    Nothing is conjured, nothing is hidden.  Every tool, weapon, and armor piece  
    belongs to this record when its making can be traced from what lies in reach.

CATEGORIES
    tools      implements that serve the body in labour and repair  
    weapons    instruments that carry force for hunting or defense  
    armor      coverings that turn tooth, claw, wind, or cold  

USE
    The pages that follow describe each class of making in their lawful order.  
    They hold no secret instruction, only the witness of matter shaped to purpose.

NOTES
    Crafting is labour, not progress.  A form once lost must be relearned by sight.  
    The valley permits no art beyond what its soil and ruin provide.  
    Every object that endures does so because the hands remember.
