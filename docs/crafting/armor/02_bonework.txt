NAME
    bonework

DESCRIPTION
    Bonework is armor made from the valley’s remains.  
    It takes the strength of what has fallen and gives it new purpose.  
    Every plate remembers a creature’s motion even in stillness.

FORM
    Ribs split lengthwise and drilled for cord.  
    Shoulder blades ground flat and fitted in rows along hide backing.  
    Long bones carved into narrow slats, bound together with sinew and wax.  
    Smoke and ash seal the surface against damp.

USE
    Worn over chest and arm to turn claw, tooth, and falling stone.  
    Heavy, loud, but steadfast.  In winter it holds heat as well as defense.  
    The weight settles upon the body until strength and burden are one.

LIMITS
    Bone cracks in deep cold and softens when left in rain.  
    Each piece must be dried by firelight and restrung before use.

NOTES
    To wear bonework is to walk with the memory of other lives.  
    Every plate sings faintly when struck, a hollow echo of what it once was.
