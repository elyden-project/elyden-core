NAME
    armor index

DESCRIPTION
    Armor is the second skin of survival.  
    It guards flesh against tooth, edge, and cold.  
    Every piece is woven from fear, necessity, and the patience of hands.

FORM
    Hide shaped and stitched.  Bone pierced and strung.  
    Reed padded into layers.  Bark pressed and smoked until pliant.  
    From these beginnings come the coverings that keep life where it belongs.

CATEGORIES
    hidework       the soft barrier between skin and storm  
    bonework       the hard shell against claw and stone  
    reedpadding    the quiet armor of cold and silence  
    shields        the held wall between self and harm  
    trophies       the marks of victory worn as proof or prayer

USE
    Armor slows the world’s intention.  
    It absorbs what would otherwise end the motion of the living.

NOTES
    Protection is weight.  Warmth is burden.  
    The wise know when to wear defense and when to shed it.
