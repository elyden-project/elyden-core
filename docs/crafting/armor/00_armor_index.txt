DESCRIPTION
    Armor is the second skin of survival.  
    It guards flesh against tooth, edge, and cold.  
    Every piece is woven from fear, necessity, and the patience of hands.

FORM
    Hide shaped and stitched.  Bone pierced and strung.  
    Reed padded into layers.  Bark pressed and smoked until pliant.  
    From these beginnings come the coverings that keep life where it belongs.

CATEGORIES

USE
    Armor slows the worldâ€™s intention.  
    It absorbs what would otherwise end the motion of the living.

NOTES
    Protection is weight.  Warmth is burden.  
    The wise know when to wear defense and when to shed it.
