NAME
    reedpadding

DESCRIPTION
    Reedpadding is the armor of quiet places.  
    It is woven from the hollow stems that grow where water lingers and wind is soft.  
    Its purpose is warmth first, protection second, silence always.

FORM
    Reeds gathered at dusk, split and dried by the fire’s edge.  
    Bundled and stitched into mats with cord of bark or grass.  
    The mats layered over hide or cloth, sewn into vests and sleeves.  
    Moss or lichen pressed between layers for softness and insulation.

USE
    For keeping the cold from bone and dulling the blow of branch or fall.  
    Favored by those who hunt with bow, for it makes no sound in motion.  
    When damp, it smells of earth and smoke but keeps its shape.

LIMITS
    Reeds grow brittle in frost and must be replaced with the season.  
    If soaked too long, the stitching loosens and decay begins from within.

NOTES
    Reedpadding does not fight; it endures.  
    It teaches that defense can be found in gentleness.
