NAME
    hidework

DESCRIPTION
    Hidework is the oldest form of shelter carried on the body.  
    It turns the death of beast into the warmth of survival.  
    Each layer bears the scent of smoke, fat, and rain.

FORM
    Fresh hide scraped clean, stretched across wood, dried in shade.  
    When pliant, rubbed with ash and grease until soft to touch.  
    Cut to shape and stitched with sinew or grass cord.  
    Smoke darkens the surface and drives out the last of blood.

USE
    For covering the body, for binding the hands in frost, for wrapping the feet.  
    Thick hides guard the chest from thorn and blow; thin ones bend with movement.  
    Worn close, they breathe with the wearerâ€™s heat.

LIMITS
    Hide stiffens when soaked, rots when sealed too long from air.  
    Fire will cure it or consume it-no middle path endures.

NOTES
    The first garment was an answer to the wind.  
    Every piece of hidework repeats that conversation.
