NAME
    trophies

DESCRIPTION
    Trophies are not armor of need but of remembrance.  
    They are worn when survival has been proven, not when it is in doubt.  
    Each piece tells of a meeting between the living and the greater powers of the valley.

FORM
    Teeth and claws drilled and strung upon cord.  
    Horn plates polished and set into hide bands.  
    A strip of fur wrapped at wrist or throat, still carrying its scent.  
    Feathers bound to cord, shifting with the motion of breath.  
    Bone carved into charm or edge to mark endurance.

USE
    For ceremony of silence and for courage before hunt.  
    To remind the wearer of what was taken and what was spared.  
    Some believe the spirit of the fallen walks beside its keeper until forgotten.

LIMITS
    Ornament invites memory but not protection.  
    Weight without purpose wearies the body.  
    The valley cares little for pride worn on the skin.

NOTES
    A trophy kept too long becomes burden.  
    The wise return them to earth before envy grows.
