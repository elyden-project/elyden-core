NAME
    shields

DESCRIPTION
    The shield is the held wall between the body and the world.  
    It is armor that moves with the will, turning danger aside through balance and timing.  
    In the valley it is built from what stands firm and bends without breaking.

FORM
    A circle of wood or woven branch, its rim bound with hide.  
    The face stretched tight with raw skin, smoked until it hardens.  
    A handgrip carved from bone or antler fixed at the heart.  
    Some bear plates of slate or fragments of ruin metal pressed into their surface.  
    Smoke and resin darken them against the glare of snow.

USE
    To catch the force of strike, to hide movement, to push through thorn and crowd.  
    When raised, it is a door that opens only one way.  
    In rest it serves as seat, table, or shelter from rain.

LIMITS
    Wood swells and twists in wet.  Hide shrinks and splits in heat.  
    A broken rim must be unbound and remade; a cracked face cannot be mended.

NOTES
    The shield belongs to the moment before impact.  
    Its worth is measured in what it prevents, not what it endures.
