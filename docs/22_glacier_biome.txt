NAME  
    glacier_biome − elevated ice shelf with unstable footing, meltwater channels, and scarce adapted life

DESCRIPTION  
    This biome is formed from ancient, slow-moving ice compressed over thousands of years.  
    Terrain is fractured, layered, and constantly shifting.  
    Crevasses may be concealed by snow crust. Surface is hard and light-scattering.  
    Meltwater flows briefly in sun-exposed channels. Some ledges hold trapped warmth or runoff pools.  
    Plant life is absent, but certain microscopic algae and trace scavengers persist.  
    Movement is dangerous but possible. Food is limited to what crosses or clings.

PROPERTIES  
    • visibility − distorted by glare and terrain shifts  
    • cover − none (ice only)  
    • traversal − hazardous (crevasse risk, slip, collapse)  
    • heat retention − none  
    • elevation shift − high (ridge lines, drop-offs)  
    • water surface − seasonal melt pools only  
    • survivability − extremely low, not impossible

INORGANIC MATERIALS  
    • blue ice — dense, refracts internal light  
    • surface crust — thin layer, hides depth shifts  
    • frost lens — holds meltwater briefly  
    • embedded stone — dragged by iceflow, visible in layers  
    • iron fleck — found near edge melt  
    • dry rime — shatters on touch

FLORA  
    TREES  
        • none  
    SHRUBS  
        • none  
    HERBS  
        • none  
    FUNGI  
        • none  
    GRASSES  
        • none  
    MICROFLORA  
        • snow algae — red or green bloom, edible trace amounts

FAUNA  
    INSECTS  
        • glacier midge — tiny, clings to warm skin  
    BIRDS  
        • gull — passes overhead during thaw, does not land  
    MAMMALS  
        • arctic fox — solitary scavenger, follows melt path  
        • wolverine — crosses high ridges, may track movement

AGGRESSIVE FAUNA  
    • wolverine — attacks if followed or cornered  
    • glacier midge — bites exposed skin in swarms
