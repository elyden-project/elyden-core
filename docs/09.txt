NAME  
    evergreen_forest_biome − densely wooded terrain with partial canopy and persistent moisture

DESCRIPTION  
    Evergreen forests consist of overlapping coniferous canopies with scattered clearings.  
    Terrain is uneven, with thick root networks, loamy underlayers, and decomposing foliage.  
    Water is retained in moss beds, low ruts, and shaded stone basins.  
    Light is filtered and movement is partially concealed. Fallen logs and thick brush reduce visibility.

PROPERTIES  
    • visibility − low  
    • cover − high (foliage, trunk spacing)  
    • traversal − impeded (roots, moss, fallen logs)  
    • heat retention − moderate (ambient)  
    • elevation shift − minor  
    • water surface − intermittent (retained by terrain)

INORGANIC MATERIALS  
    • weathered stone  
    • compacted loam  
    • dark gravel  
    • silica flecks (trace)  
    • bark resin deposits  
    • decomposed lignin (unusable)

FLORA  
    TREES  
        • pine — tall, dense, resinous  
        • spruce — thin-needled, straight-limbed  
        • fir — flexible trunk, aromatic  
    SHRUBS & SUCCULENTS  
        • bramble — thorned, produces fruit  
        • alder brush — edible leaves (boiled)  
    HERBS  
        • fernroot — edible tuber (cooked)  
        • wild sage — aromatic, used in masking scent  
    GRASSES  
        • woodstalk — tall, flexible  
    FUNGI  
        • deadcap — toxic  
        • mosshorn — edible, grows near base of trunks  
        • turkey tail — fibrous shelf fungus  
        • pine ear — edible (requires drying)

FAUNA  
    INSECTS  
        • bark beetle — wood burrower, favors dead trees  
        • mite — skin irritant, clings to underbrush  
        • net-spinning caterpillar — creates webbing across trails  
    BIRDS  
        • jay — noisy, travels in groups  
        • crow — scavenger, gathers near openings  
    MAMMALS  
        • roe deer — skittish grazer, active at dusk  
        • black bear — large omnivore, roams alone  
        • red squirrel — tree-dwelling forager  
    REPTILES  
        • smooth snake — non-venomous, hides under logs  
    AMPHIBIANS  
        • newt — moist-skinned insectivore, retreats under leaf cover  
        • common toad — toxic secretions, slow-moving

AGGRESSIVE FAUNA  
    • black bear — charges if startled, avoids groups  
    • common toad — secretes skin toxin when handled  
    • mite — irritates exposed skin if disturbed
