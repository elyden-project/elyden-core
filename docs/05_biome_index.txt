DESCRIPTION  
    The following biomes are confirmed within the sealed valley.  
    Each is an independent domain with distinct terrain and conditions.  
    All are explorable through traversal. No access restrictions are imposed.  

    Short-form keys are assigned for reference or potential mapping use.  
    Icons are visual markers only and carry no simulation behavior.
