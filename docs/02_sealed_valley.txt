NAME  
    sealed_valley - record of the last survivable region

DESCRIPTION  
    After Vaeronth collapsed, the moons fell out of rhythm. Weather  
    systems became unstable. Permafrost spread. Temperatures dropped  
    faster than they could recover. Most of the planet became  
    uninhabitable.

    In their last known alignment, the surviving moons triggered a  
    tectonic shift. A deep valley was sealed by rising ridges.  
    The basin became cut off from the rest of the world.

    The sealed valley is the last region where the environment still  
    works. Heat is retained. Weather repeats. Plants grow. Cycles  
    respond to the seasons. Life continues.

    Outside the valley, collapse is unchecked. Most of the surface is  
    frozen, scorched, or lifeless. Weather is erratic. Signals no  
    longer follow pattern. Time is difficult to track.

    Civilization did not survive. The systems inside the valley held,  
    but language, order, and memory degraded. The cause is not fully  
    understood. The presence of Khyrael continued after the sealing  
    and is believed to have interfered with continuity.

    The valley was sealed by lunar alignment. The remaining moons  
    acted in final resonance to isolate the basin. No further  
    alignment has occurred since.
