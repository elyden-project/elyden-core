NAME  
    tundra_biome − cold plains with sparse vegetation, shallow root depth, and seasonal thaw

DESCRIPTION  
    The tundra is a treeless plain where cold wind moves across open soil and sparse vegetation.  
    The top layer of soil thaws briefly in warmer seasons but refreezes below.  
    Snow remains in shaded pockets year-round. Moisture is present but shallow.  
    Flora grows low to the ground, adapted to short light cycles.  
    Stone holds warmth from midday sun. Food is lean but present.  
    Movement is slow when frozen, muddy when thawed.

PROPERTIES  
    • visibility − wide open  
    • cover − minimal (low flora, snow rise)  
    • traversal − unimpeded but tiring  
    • heat retention − poor (cold wind exposure)  
    • elevation shift − flat to gently rolling  
    • water surface − shallow, seasonal thaw  
    • resource density − low but viable

INORGANIC MATERIALS  
    • frozen clay — hard until thaw  
    • frost-stone — pitted surface, holds midday heat  
    • surface gravel — scattered near ridgelines  
    • iron nodules — visible after melt  
    • compacted earth — dry, suitable for shaping  
    • glacial runoff — temporary streams

FLORA  
    TREES  
        • dwarf willow — knee-high, flexible branches  
        • arctic birch — stunted, peeling bark  
    SHRUBS  
        • bearberry — low, red berries in cold  
        • crowberry — mat-forming, edible black fruits  
    HERBS  
        • mountain sorrel — tart, grows in melt pools  
        • arctic poppy — yellow flower, tracks sun  
    FUNGI  
        • reindeer lichen — sponge-like, pale green  
        • frost mushroom — edible when fresh  
    GRASSES  
        • cotton grass — white-tufted, found in bog zones  
        • tufted sedge — forms mounds in permafrost

FAUNA  
    INSECTS  
        • tundra mosquito — swarms in thaw, blood-seeking  
        • snow flea — springtail, jumps in melt periods  
    BIRDS  
        • snow bunting — ground forager, active in early thaw  
        • ptarmigan — changes color with season, hides in brush  
        • arctic tern — migrates through, loud in flight  
    MAMMALS  
        • arctic hare — fast, digs shallow forms  
        • lemming — burrows under snow layer  
        • muskox — herds for warmth, charges when encircled  
        • red fox — scavenger, follows melt lines  
        • gray wolf — hunts in coordinated pack, active at dusk

AGGRESSIVE FAUNA  
    • muskox — charges if threatened  
    • gray wolf — pack hunter, shadows targets for hours  
    • tundra mosquito — drains blood if left exposed
