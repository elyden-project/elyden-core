NAME  
    shard_behavior - inert celestial fragments retained by megafauna

DESCRIPTION  
    Shards are small fragments of Vaeronth, the moon associated with  
    structural order and arcane resonance. After Vaeronth collapsed,  
    its remnants dispersed into planetary orbit. Most debris became  
    part of the ring structure that now surrounds Elyden.

    A minority of fragments reached the surface. These pieces are  
    inert, dense, and structurally irregular. They do not emit light,  
    react to stimuli, or show internal energy. No known device has  
    succeeded in altering or replicating a shard.

    Shards are no longer found on open ground. They are now retained  
    exclusively within megafauna - large, rare organisms that have  
    adapted to survive the collapse. A shard is released only when  
    such a creature is killed. No other method of extraction has  
    proven successful.

    When recovered, shards can be bound to a single item: a weapon  
    or a piece of armor. The process does not require tools, heat,  
    or ritual. Contact is sufficient. The item becomes altered.  
    Functionality improves in ways that support survival.

    Shards are consumed on use. They cannot be reused, broken down,  
    or extracted once applied. Each item can receive only one shard.

    The internal structure of shards appears crystalline under  
    magnification, though patterns differ between samples. All  
    share physical properties: weight, hardness, and fracture  
    resistance well beyond native materials. No atmospheric or  
    biological effect has been recorded from exposure.
