NAME  
    celestial_bodies − orbital bodies observed from elyden

DESCRIPTION  
    Elyden orbits Aurenzae, a red dwarf.

    Five moons were once visible in stable rotation:
        • Taeryniel  
        • Irraketh  
        • Lovaen  
        • Serunel  
        • Vaeronth  

    Each moon was observed, named, and tracked over time.  
    Their cycles were once associated with patterns of season, memory, and survival.  
    Vaeronth alone exhibited orbital regularity linked to continuity and logic.  
    Its collapse marked the end of celestial influence.

    After Vaeronth’s failure, a sixth object appeared:
        • Khyrael  

    Khyrael does not emit or reflect light.  
    It does not follow the orbital rhythm of the former moons.  
    Its arrival coincided with widespread system decay.  
    No further alignment or influence is present.

NOTES  
    • Aurenzae remains stable and visible  
    • Vaeronth appears as a debris ring in the upper sky  
    • Khyrael’s motion is irregular and unsynchronized  
    • No moon currently exhibits any measurable influence on Elyden’s surface  
    • The sealing of the valley was the final act linked to the celestial system
