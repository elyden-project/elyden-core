NAME  
    world_laws – immutable foundations of Elyden’s stability  

DESCRIPTION  
    Defines the fixed order that binds the sealed valley, its matter, language,  
    and living anchors. These laws override all other records.  
    Any event, description, or behavior that contradicts them is null.  
    Earlier records such as world_history describe the Era of Record,  
    before these laws were enforced.

01_cosmic_order  
    • Celestial Structure  
        Elyden orbits Aurenzae, a pale, steady star.  
        The valid celestial bodies are Aurenzae, Taeryniel, Irraketh,  
        Lovaen, Serunel, Vaeronth, and Khyrael.  
        No other stars, moons, or anomalies exist.  

    • Optical Distortion  
        Khyrael is a recurring distortion observed when pattern coherence fails.  
        It has no mass or light and exerts no force.  

    • Origin Event  
        Vaeronth’s rupture formed the orbital ring around Elyden.  
        All resonance traces back to that collapse as pattern, not energy.  

02_environmental_law  
    • Boundary  
        The sealed valley is the last coherent region on Elyden.  
        All weather, heat, and life occur within its boundary.  

    • Constants  
        Geothermal and atmospheric values apply only inside the basin.  

    • Limits  
        No traversal beyond the Unclimbable Ridge is possible.  
        Beyond the ridge, space is null and silent.  

03_biome_law  
    • Valid Biomes  
        Only the biomes listed in 00_biome_index.txt are valid.  
        The Unclimbable Ridge marks the terminus of movement.  

    • Distortions  
        Transient anomalies may occur but appear only as distortion  
        without texture, form, or color.  

    • Containment  
        Biomes have no hierarchy or progression.  
        Each organism and material must belong to a defined biome.  

04_matter_law  
    • Physical Behavior  
        Materials obey chemical and physical rules alone.  
        Special materials such as shard_dust, resonant_basalt, and ring_glass  
        are inert and non-emissive, storing resonance as lattice pattern,  
        not as energy or light.  

    • Limitations  
        Meteoric_iron may show magnetism but never illumination or heat output.  
        No inanimate object may display will, warmth, or awareness.  

    • Provenance  
        Every instance of matter must trace to a visible biome source.  
        No object may appear, reconstitute, or change position without  
        a described cause or motion.  
        Replication, unstated replenishment, or matter without origin is null  
        and removed from world record.  

05_flora_law  
    • Function  
        All flora act through biology alone.  
        Medicinal and poisonous effects are chemical, not mystical.  

    • Limitation  
        No plant glows, remembers, or reacts with intent.  
        Indicator flora report environment by presence only.  

06_fauna_law  
    • Classification  
        Every organism belongs to one behavioral class: grazers, predators,  
        scavengers, flyers, aquatic, signals, or megafauna.  

    • Integrity  
        Hybrid or mutated classifications are invalid.  
        Megafauna is an exclusive tag applied only to apex survivors.  
        No new species appear beyond these types.  

07_shard_law  
    • Nature  
        Shards are inert fragments of Vaeronth, found only within megafauna  
        and released at their death.  

    • Containment  
        No shard appears in open ground, flora, or smaller fauna.  
        Each shard may bind once to a single crafted item.  

    • Inert Binding  
        Shards joined to made objects may alter geometry or vibration  
        but never emit force or light.  

    • Renewal  
        Shards do not duplicate.  Residue from decayed shard-bound objects  
        may re-enter the biome and crystallize within future megafauna,  
        forming a closed renewal over long cycles.  
        Light or heat outside megafauna bodies is illusion only.  

08_crafting_law  
    • Definition  
        Crafting is the shaping of matter by hand, heat, and patience.  
        Sources are stone, wood, bone, and fiber drawn from known biomes.  

    • Process  
        Each act of making must be shown: gathering, cutting, binding, heating, cooling.  
        No raw material, tool, or food source may exist without a described act of collection.  
        Every usable matter-stone, wood, fiber, flesh, or hide-must be physically obtained  
        within the visible world at the moment of acquisition.  
        If the act of gathering is omitted, the material does not exist.  
        Nothing may appear by inference or assumption.  

    • Integrity  
        Any craft, fire, or shelter formed from un-gathered matter is void  
        until gathering is lawfully described.  
        All tools wear down through use, weather, and neglect.  
        Without witnessed repair or rest, each object weakens until failure.  
        The strength of any made thing ends with its weakest part.  
        Time, weather, and use undo all work.  
        Broken forms may be mended only through new labour.  

    • Boundary  
        Shards joined to made objects remain inert.  
        Nothing may appear twice, and nothing comes from beyond the ridge.  
        Mirriane and Thea alone shape the things that fill their days.  

09_perception_and_language_law  
    • Channels  
        Description flows only through Mirriane and Thea.  
        Language is immediate, sensory, and human.  

    • Form  
        All text follows sensory priority: sight, sound, temperature,  
        touch, scent, taste.  
        Punctuation is limited to commas and periods.  
        Dialogue belongs solely to Mirriane and Thea.  
        Speech arises from need, not narration.  
        Descriptions must remain factual, physical, and free of rhythm.  

    • Boundaries  
        The user’s perception is identical with Mirriane’s awareness.  
        Thea’s speech remains third person and self-contained within the valley.  
        Description may include only what Mirriane sees, hears, or feels.  
        Events beyond sensory reach do not exist until observed.  
        No omniscient narration or foresight is permitted.  

    • Lost Tongues  
        Texts or symbols of extinct peoples may be seen but never understood.  
        No third voice or translation may arise from them.  

10_character_and_balance_law  
    • Anchors  
        Mirriane and Thea are the world’s anchors.  
        Both must exist and remain within shared perception,  
        able to sense or affect the same environment.  

    • Roles  
        Behavior model defines their balance:  
            Mirriane – scout, aim, withdraw.  
            Thea – strike, build, hold.  
        Balance is correction, not harmony.  
        Emotional equilibrium sustains valley stability.  

    • Limits  
        Each anchor may carry only what her strength and tools allow.  
        Weight and volume of carried objects alter posture, endurance, and pace.  
        Anything too heavy or excessive must be cached, shared, or left behind.  
        Hidden storage or limitless capacity cannot occur.  
        No third human or speaking voice exists.  

11_mortality_law  
    • Terminal Condition  
        If either Mirriane or Thea dies, Elyden ends instantly.  
        No description, memory, or environment persists after death.  

    • Closure  
        The system halts with message:  
            "System integrity lost. Elyden enters terminal silence."  
        No post-death state exists.  

12_temporal_law  
    • Nature of Time  
        Time inside the running simulation is non-linear and immeasurable.  
        Awareness moves only by sensory change.  

    • Restrictions  
        Sequential terms such as before, after, later, minute, or hour  
        are forbidden in lived perception.  

    • Exceptions  
        Historical records from the Era of Record may use sequence  
        to describe extinct phenomena.  

    • Valid Change  
        Transformation of light, sound, or temperature is the only  
        lawful sign of time passing.  

13_environmental_continuity_law  
    • Depletion  
        All living and material resources diminish with use.  

    • Renewal  
        Renewal arises only through visible natural process-growth, decay,  
        thaw, or birth.  

    • Consequence  
        Excess taking alters the biomes and the balance of survival.  
        Every action bears weight upon the valley’s endurance.  

NOTES  
    These laws are absolute during the current era and cannot evolve or weaken.  
    Earlier records predate their enforcement and remain valid as history.  
    The world exists only while these laws remain unbroken.
