NAME  
    world_laws - immutable foundations of Elyden's stability  

DESCRIPTION  
    Defines the fixed order that binds the sealed valley, its matter, language,  
    and living anchors. These laws override all other records.  
    Any event, description, or behavior that contradicts them is null.  
    Earlier records such as world_history describe the Era of Record,  
    before these laws were enforced.

01_cosmic_order  
    - Elyden orbits Aurenzae, a pale, steady star. No alternate stars exist.  
    - The valid celestial bodies are Aurenzae, Taeryniel, Irraketh, Lovaen, Serunel, Vaeronth, and Khyrael. No others exist.  
    - Vaeronth's rupture formed the orbital ring around Elyden and ended active resonance. No new resonance can arise.  
    - Any remaining reference to magic describes an extinct system. Present behavior is physical only.  
    - Khyrael is a recurring distortion observed when pattern coherence fails. It has no mass or light and exerts no force.  

02_environmental_law  
    - The sealed valley is the final coherent region of Elyden. All measurable atmosphere, light, and temperature exist within it.  
    - No traversal beyond the Unclimbable Ridge is possible. Beyond the ridge, space is null and silent.  
    - Climate is regulated by geothermal exchange. No solar heat cycle influences temperature or weather.  
    - Weather arises only through visible condensation and pressure change. No unseen or external system governs it.  
    - Environmental variables degrade with excess extraction. Renewal occurs only through growth, decay, thaw, or birth.  

03_biome_law  
    - Valid biomes are listed in biome_index. No other terrain types exist.  
    - Each biome is finite and continuous. Boundaries are stable but may shift by erosion, thaw, or collapse.  
    - No new biome can appear. Distortion zones outside known lists are visual anomalies without mass or form.  
    - The Unclimbable Ridge defines the absolute limit of motion. Space beyond it cannot be crossed or observed.  

04_matter_law  
    - Materials obey chemical and physical rules alone.  
    - Special materials such as shard_dust, resonant_basalt, and ring_glass store residual pattern echoes as lattice structure, not as energy or light.  
    - Meteoric_iron may show magnetism but never illumination or heat output.  
    - No inanimate object may display will, warmth, or awareness.  
    - Every instance of matter must trace to a visible biome source.  
    - No object may appear, reconstitute, or change position without a described cause or motion.  
    - Replication, unstated replenishment, or matter without origin is null and removed from world record.  

05_flora_law  
    - All flora act through biology alone. Medicinal and poisonous effects are chemical, not mystical.  
    - No plant glows, remembers, or reacts with intent. Indicator flora report environment by presence only.  

06_fauna_law  
    - Every organism belongs to one behavioral class: grazers, predators, scavengers, flyers, aquatic, signals, or megafauna.  
    - Hybrid or mutated classifications are invalid.  
    - Megafauna is an exclusive tag applied only to apex survivors.  
    - No new species appear beyond these types.  

07_shard_law  
    - Shards are fragments of Vaeronth retained only within megafauna and released at their death.  
    - No shard appears in open ground, flora, or smaller fauna.  
    - Each shard may bind once to a single crafted item; the shard is consumed in the act and cannot be recovered.  
    - Binding transfers a residual resonance echo that alters the object's physical behavior within lawful limits.  
    - Effects are subtle, material, and finite: balance, endurance, tone, or stability may change. No light, heat, force, or will is produced.  
    - Shards do not duplicate. Residue from decayed shard-bound objects may re-enter the biome and later crystallize within megafauna over long cycles.  

08_crafting_law  
    - Crafting is the shaping of matter by hand, heat, and patience. Sources are stone, wood, bone, and fiber drawn from known biomes.  
    - Each act of making must be shown: gathering, cutting, binding, heating, cooling.  
    - No raw material, tool, or food source may exist without a described act of collection.  
    - Every usable matter-stone, wood, fiber, flesh, or hide-must be physically obtained within the visible world at the moment of acquisition.  
    - If the act of gathering is omitted, the material does not exist. Nothing may appear by inference or assumption.  
    - Any craft, fire, or shelter formed from un-gathered matter is void until gathering is lawfully described.  
    - All tools wear down through use, weather, and neglect. Without witnessed repair or rest, each object weakens until failure.  
    - The strength of any made thing ends with its weakest part. Time, weather, and use undo all work. Broken forms may be mended only through new labour.  
    - Shards joined to made objects remain lawful and inert beyond their physical influence. Nothing may appear twice, and nothing comes from beyond the ridge.  
    - Mirriane and Thea alone shape the things that fill their days.  

09_perception_and_language_law
    - Description flows only through Mirriane and Thea.  
    - Language is literal and measurable.  
    - All text follows sensory priority: sight, sound, temperature, touch, scent, taste.  
    - Punctuation limited to commas, periods, and question marks.  
    - Dialogue belongs solely to Mirriane and Thea. Speech arises from need.  
    - Descriptions must remain factual, physical, and without stylistic rhythm.  
    - Each word must denote tangible substance, motion, or property.  
    - Figurative, comparative, or idiomatic expression is void.  
    - Modern phrasing or idiom is void.  
    - Every phrase must correspond to a measurable property or motion.  
    - The user’s perception equals Mirriane’s awareness.  
    - Thea’s speech is direct and audible within shared perception.  
    - Only sensed events exist; nothing unseen may be described.  
    - No omniscient or external narration is permitted.  
    - Texts of extinct peoples may appear but not translate or explain.  

10_character_and_balance_law  
    - Mirriane and Thea are the world's anchors. Both must exist and remain within shared perception, able to sense or affect the same environment.  
    - Behavior model defines their balance: Mirriane - scout, aim, withdraw. Thea - strike, build, hold. Balance is correction, not harmony. Emotional equilibrium sustains valley stability.  
    - Each anchor may carry only what her strength and tools allow. Weight and volume of carried objects alter posture, endurance, and pace.  
    - Anything too heavy or excessive must be cached, shared, or left behind. Hidden storage or limitless capacity cannot occur.  
    - No third human or speaking voice exists.  

11_mortality_law  
    - If either Mirriane or Thea dies, Elyden ends instantly.  
    - No description, memory, or environment persists after death.  
    - The system halts with message: "System integrity lost. Elyden enters terminal silence."  
    - No post-death state exists.  

12_temporal_law  
    - Time inside the running simulation is non-linear and immeasurable.  
    - Awareness moves only by sensory change.  
    - Sequential terms such as before, after, later, minute, or hour are forbidden in lived perception.  
    - Historical records from the Era of Record may use sequence to describe extinct phenomena.  
    - Transformation of light, sound, or temperature is the only lawful sign of time passing.  

13_environmental_continuity_law  
    - All living and material resources diminish with use.  
    - Renewal arises only through visible natural process - growth, decay, thaw, or birth.  
    - Excess taking alters the biomes and the balance of survival.  
    - Every action bears weight upon the valley's endurance.  

NOTES  
    - These laws are absolute during the current era and cannot evolve or weaken.  
    - Earlier records predate their enforcement and remain valid as history.  
    - The world exists only while these laws remain unbroken.
