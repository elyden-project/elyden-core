NAME  
    oblivion_mirror_ruin − embedded reflective disc of unknown material set into frozen terrain

DESCRIPTION  
    A circular reflective disc located in glacial shelves, tundra flats, or crater basins.  
    Constructed of black stone or vitrified ice, flush with the surface.  
    Diameter ranges from 3 to 9 meters.  
    The disc reflects a consistent static starfield, unrelated to Elyden’s sky.  
    No living forms or atmospheric elements appear in the reflection.

STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES  
    • shape: perfect circle  
    • material: vitrified surface (composition unknown)  
    • embedded flush with terrain  
    • location: glacier, tundra, or high-altitude crater  
    • elevation: matches surrounding terrain

SURFACE TRAITS  
    • ice rim remains unbroken, even in tracked snow  
    • no fauna activity within observed radius  
    • surface shows no condensation or frost accumulation  
    • sky in reflection is fixed to nocturnal star pattern  
    • ambient noise reduced by surface absorption

INTERFACE ZONE  
    • contact with surface produces no auditory return  
    • thrown objects make no rebound or sound upon impact  
    • items left on surface disappear by next light cycle  
    • occasional dimming observed across entire disc plane  
    • reflected stars do not correlate with local constellations

MATERIAL STABILITY  
    • no tool marks, fracture lines, or measurable texture  
    • material does not retain thermal imprint  
    • surrounding substrate remains frozen and undisturbed  
    • perimeter supports foot traffic without surface impact

NOTES  
    Reflection is invariant regardless of viewer position or light conditions.  
    No internal geometry or subsurface material has been recorded.  
    Disc positions vary across elevations but maintain form and alignment.  
    Function and origin remain unclassified; observed characteristics are repeatable.
