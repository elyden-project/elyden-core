NAME
    ring slag - vitrified debris from Vaeronthâ€™s fallen ring

DESCRIPTION
    Black-green and glassy with thin metallic veins.
    Warm to the touch in moonlight, faintly magnetic near basalt.

ORIGIN
    Formed when fragments of the broken lunar ring struck the valley surface,
    fusing soil and metal dust into solid slag masses.

USE
    Used for small cutting tools and ornaments of trade value.
    When ground fine, mixed into resin for strength and conductivity.

LIMITATIONS
    Difficult to shape; shatters if cooled too fast.
    Emits weak static hum that disrupts fire resonance if piled.

ZONE_PRESENCE
    ringfall sites, ridge fields, ash deposits
