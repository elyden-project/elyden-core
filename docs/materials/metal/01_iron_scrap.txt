NAME
    iron scrap - remnants of pre-collapse metal recovered from ruins

DESCRIPTION
    Dark and rough-edged, often streaked with rust and ash.
    Cold to the touch even near fire, heavy for its size.

ORIGIN
    Found within the debris of ruin structures or scattered in ash fields.
    Fragments from old tools, fittings, or structural plates.

USE
    Reworked into blades, hooks, and bindings when reheated in charcoal beds.
    Holds sharper edges than stone but dulls quickly.

LIMITATIONS
    Brittle, flakes under repeated stress.
    Too rare for waste; every piece re-forged until gone.

ZONE_PRESENCE
    ruins, ash fields, ridge base
