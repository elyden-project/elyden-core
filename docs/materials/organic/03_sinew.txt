NAME
    sinew - fibrous tendon used for binding and thread

DESCRIPTION
    Tough, silver-gray strands that shrink when dry and tighten when wet.

    Cleaned with water, dried in shade, and split into fine threads.

USE

    Contracts as it dries, sealing joints without resin.

LIMITATIONS

    Must be softened with warm water before handling.

ZONE_PRESENCE
