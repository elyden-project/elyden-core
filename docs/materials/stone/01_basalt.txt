NAME
    basalt - dense volcanic stone used for striking and grinding

DESCRIPTION
    Dark, heavy, fine-grained rock that holds heat and sound.
    Its surface drinks light and sweats when warmed by hand.

ORIGIN
    Formed where molten ground cooled under the ridge slopes
    and in the deep vents of the volcanic field.

USE
    Used for hearth beds, tool weights, and grinding stones.
    When struck, it gives a dull metallic tone that guides
    tuning of camp fires and work rhythm.

LIMITATIONS
    Too dense to shape by hand tools; pieces are collected
    where natural fractures occur.

ZONE_PRESENCE
    volcanic slope, ridge base, ash field margins
