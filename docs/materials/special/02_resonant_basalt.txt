NAME
    resonant basalt - low vibration stone drawn from ruin foundations

DESCRIPTION
    Dark and smooth, heavier than ordinary basalt.
    When struck, releases a slow echo that fades into the ground.

ORIGIN
    Quarried from the buried bases of ancient ruin structures
    where lunar resonance once passed through stone.

USE
    Used for altar blocks, sound markers, and stabilizing walls.
    Helps maintain environmental rhythm near habitation zones.

LIMITATIONS
    Difficult to cut; loses tone if heated too fast.
    Should not be stacked against regular basalt-causes harmonic drift.

ZONE_PRESENCE
    ruin foundations, ridge base, sealed valley thresholds
