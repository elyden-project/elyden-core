NAME  
    celestial bodies − aurenzae and the moons of elyden

DESCRIPTION  
    six moons orbit elyden, and one quiet star rises above them.  
    once, their cycles held meaning—tides, seasons, memory.  
    now, their orbits drift. no calendars remain. no names  
    are spoken aloud. but their effects are felt. always.

    the moons do not punish. they shift. they bend life into  
    new shapes. anyone who survives long enough learns to feel  
    when one is near.

    nothing in the sky offers prophecy. only rhythm.

AURENZAE − sun  
    red and quiet. warms the valley just enough to hold breath  
    through long winters. on clear days, it hums low. on others,  
    it flickers and vanishes for hours. not feared. not trusted.  
    but welcome, when seen.

TAERYNIEL − earth moon  
    brings weight to stone and sap. tools sit heavier.  
    roots thicken. sleeping near stone is deeper, harder.  
    fissures widen. caves breathe slow.

IRRAKETH − fire moon  
    lights vents and sparks hidden tinder. wounds close faster  
    but fever comes quicker. insects rise. forgework, when it  
    exists, happens here.

LOVAEN − air moon  
    shifts the wind’s edge. carries scents far, or nowhere.  
    speech feels thinner. songs stretch longer. birds follow it.  
    if they disappear, it has passed.

SERUNEL − water moon  
    makes mist thicken and wells rise. skin softens.  
    rain lingers in the throat. things long buried surface  
    in riverbeds. sometimes they breathe.

VAERONTH − magic moon  
    no longer whole. once shaped memory and logic. now broken.  
    its fragments fall cold. they do not glow. they interfere  
    with purpose. still, some say they can be bound.

KHYRAEL − unknown satellite  
    was never named in the old cycle. dim and still.  
    things slow under it. sprouting halts. sound becomes  
    close. animals turn the wrong way. it does not move fast,  
    but it always returns.

NOTES  
    when two moons align, weather may shift. when three cross,  
    instincts fail. four or more: expect silence, or bloom.  
    none of this is written down. it’s learned by living long.
