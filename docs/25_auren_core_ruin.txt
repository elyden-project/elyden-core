NAME  
    auren_core_ruin − vertical monolith structure aligned with radial vitrification

DESCRIPTION  
    A solitary upright structure found in dry basins or exposed hardpan.  
    Built from red-black fused material not found elsewhere in the sealed valley.  
    The core is hollowed vertically by a narrow, seamless shaft.  
    Surrounding soil is vitrified outward in a radial starburst.  
    Structure is fixed and does not exhibit any movement or alteration.

STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES  
    • height: 5–9 meters  
    • profile: monolithic, taperless  
    • material: vitrified composite, origin unknown  
    • core: internal bore, narrow and smooth  
    • base interface: embedded directly in substrate without foundation

SURFACE TRAITS  
    • no inscriptions present  
    • fluted lower bands collect windblown dust  
    • flare reflection observed during specific sun angles  
    • dry zone typically extends 3 meters from base  
    • avian activity absent; no signs of perching or nesting

THERMAL CHARACTERISTICS  
    • exterior temperature varies with diurnal cycle  
    • interior remains sheltered from wind and airborne particles  
    • no measurable echo response from interior shaft  
    • surface shows no water retention

MATERIAL STABILITY  
    • surface resists tool damage; direct impact fractures tools  
    • stone chips cannot be extracted by mechanical force  
    • lightning strike marks observed during storm events

NOTES  
    No direct correlation confirmed between this structure and fragment activity.  
    No inscriptions, language, or orientation markers have been identified.  
    Multiple field reports describe identical structures, though unmapped.  
    Current interpretations remain limited to material and positional data.
