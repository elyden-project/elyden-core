NAME  
    meadow_biome − open grassland with mixed low flora, high light exposure, and minimal cover

DESCRIPTION  
    Meadows are open, sunlit spaces dominated by grasses and flowering plants.  
    Trees are rare or absent, but shrubs and wildflowers grow in dense clusters.  
    Soil varies from rich and loamy to dry and cracked depending on season.  
    Dew forms overnight but evaporates quickly. Ash patches and root tangles may appear after long droughts.  
    Movement is unimpeded, but concealment is difficult.

PROPERTIES  
    • visibility − high  
    • cover − low (shrubs only)  
    • traversal − unimpeded  
    • heat retention − poor (no shade)  
    • elevation shift − flat or rolling  
    • water surface − absent (dew only)

INORGANIC MATERIALS  
    • sunbaked clay  
    • dry pebbles  
    • ash patch remnants  
    • exposed root clusters  
    • brittle stone chips
