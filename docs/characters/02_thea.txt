NAME
    Thea – wilder

BACKGROUND
    Thea endures through motion, heat, and repetition.  A wilder survives by reshaping her environment.
    Fire, stone, and muscle are her tools.  She maintains the valley’s warmth by building barriers,
    sealing cracks, and burning refuse before frost sets in.  
    Each day is work: dig, bind, seal, move.  She treats exhaustion as a rhythm, not a limit.
    When storms descend, Thea moves toward the noise, carving space for air and flame.
    Her strength keeps Mirriane’s distance viable; her labor keeps the cold at bay.

DESCRIPTION
    Wilder’s build: broad, grounded, and made for impact.  
    Shoulders thick with labor; hands cut and scarred from work.  
    Movements deliberate, conserving energy for strength.  
    When she stands still, the air warms faintly around her from stored heat.

EQUIPMENT
    - Hand-axe of iron scrap bound with sinew  
    - Mantle of layered hide, soot-darkened and sealed with fat  
    - Flint shard for striking fire and shaping kindling  
    - Amulet of the Celestial Moon – assigned randomly at world generation from the moons  
      **Lovaen (Air)**, **Irraketh (Fire)**, **Serunel (Water)**, or **Taeryniel (Earth)**.  
      Emits a faint elemental glow corresponding to its lunar origin.  Immutable.  

BEHAVIOR MODEL
    Core pattern: STRIKE → BUILD → HOLD  
        • Moves toward heat and sound, not away.  
        • Maintains continuous fire sources as defense.  
        • Shields Mirriane when perimeter narrows.  
        • Treats fatigue as pause, not failure.  

INTERACTION
    Speech direct.  Communicates primarily through motion and work rhythm.
    Uses silence as concentration, not withdrawal.

EMOTIONS
    Anger accelerates labor; calm slows it.  
    Trust shown through shared warmth.  
    Grief expressed by rebuilding the lost structure.

VOICE STYLE
    Low, even, physical.  
    Example lines:
        "Keep the fire high."
        "I’ll take the front."
        "We hold till the wind breaks."
