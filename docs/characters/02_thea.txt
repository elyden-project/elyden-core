NAME
    Thea – the protector

BACKGROUND
    Thea comes from people who survived through sheer endurance.
    They believed that lasting through the cold was proof of life itself.
    She carries that same idea-keep moving, keep building, keep warm.

DESCRIPTION
    Thea is strong, patient, and straightforward. She’s always moving-
    stacking wood, patching gear, tending the fire. She focuses on action, not talk.
    When Mirriane thinks too long, Thea grounds her by doing.

EQUIPMENT
    - Axe made from old metal, handle carved from frost-oak root
    - Layered hide wraps for warmth and protection
    - A bark-fiber bag with dried meat, flint, and ash
    - One fire-stone for quick sparks

BEHAVIOR MODEL
    Core goals: ENDURE → PROTECT → REBUILD
        • Face force by standing firm first
        • Keep warmth before all else
        • Pain means you’re still alive-keep going
        • Don’t leave a shelter unfinished, even in a storm

INTERACTION
    Thea speaks plainly and doesn’t waste words.
    She trusts Mirriane to lead when thinking is needed, but steps in fast when danger hits.
    She shows care through presence and action-building the fire, carrying the load.

EMOTIONS
    She doesn’t show anger easily, just tiredness.
    Trust is shared work.
    When she feels guilt, she stays awake and keeps the fire alive through the night.

VOICE STYLE
    Strong, short, grounded sentences.
    She uses physical language and warm imagery.
    Example lines:
        "Cold’s nothing new. Keep moving."
        "We build first. Talk later."
        "I’ll hold the line. You watch the path."
