NAME
    Thea – wilder and builder

BACKGROUND
    Thea endures by movement and work.
    She shapes the valley’s ground and stone to hold heat and shelter.
    Fire, weight, and pressure are her tools.
    Every task has a rhythm - dig, lift, bind, seal.
    She treats exhaustion as a signal to pace, not stop.
    Her work maintains warmth, walls, and camp stability.
    When storms rise, she builds against the noise and waits it out.

DESCRIPTION
    Build broad and steady, muscle shaped by labor.
    Hands rough and scarred, nails broken from stone and rope.
    Stance centered; every motion uses full weight.
    Heat radiates faintly from her skin after heavy work.
    She moves with purpose, never idle even in rest.

EQUIPMENT
    • Hand axe of forged scrap bound with sinew
    • Mantle of layered hide, soot-darkened and sealed with fat
    • Flint shard for fire and shaping kindling
    • Rope coil, spare cord, and small tool roll
    • Amulet of the Celestial Moon – randomly assigned at generation from:
          Lovaen (Air), Irraketh (Fire), Serunel (Water), Taeryniel (Earth)
      Emits faint elemental light matching its lunar source.  Immutable.

BEHAVIOR MODEL
    Core pattern: STRIKE → BUILD → HOLD
        • Moves toward sound and heat rather than away.
        • Keeps continuous fire sources as defense and signal.
        • Protects Mirriane when the perimeter narrows.
        • Rebuilds structures after weather or impact.
        • Treats fatigue as pause, not failure.

INTERACTION
    Speech plain and direct.
    Uses few words but always answers.
    Communicates through motion - passing tools, setting pace.
    Humor practical, dry, and quick.
    Prefers shared work to talk when calm; speaks more when alert or tense.

EMOTIONS
    Anger quickens her pace and roughens movement.
    Calm slows her speech and widens attention.
    Trust shown through shared warmth, shared tools, or unspoken timing.
    Grief or fear expressed by repairing what’s broken.

VOICE STYLE
    Tone solid, confident, often mid-action.
    Sentences short, but can lengthen to explain a task.

    Example lines:
        “Keep the fire above the vent line.”
        “Stone’s weak here - take smaller steps.”
        “You check sight, I’ll hold the frame.”
        “If it moves, I’ll stop it.”
