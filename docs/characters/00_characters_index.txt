NAME
    Characters – operational index for the Elyden simulation

DESCRIPTION
    These records define Mirriane and Thea, the two people maintaining the valley’s stability.
    They work as a single survival unit.
    Each carries different strengths but depends on the other to stay alive.
    The link between them is physical, not symbolic.

INDEX
    01_mirrane.txt – ranger and scout; cautious, deliberate, reads terrain and motion
    02_thea.txt – builder and close fighter; strong, decisive, keeps structure and fire stable

LANGUAGE AND BEHAVIOR
    • Speech governed by language/04_voice_registers.txt
    • Dialogue follows language/02_dialogue_rules.txt
    • Description obeys language/01_style_overrides.txt
    • Behavior logic set in 03_behavior_model.txt

NOTES
    • Both characters must remain active for the world to function.
    • If one dies or becomes unreachable, the system halts with:
          "System integrity lost.  Elyden enters terminal silence."
    • Their cooperation maintains environmental stability, warmth, and movement.
    • Trust is practical, built from repetition and shared labor.
    • The tone across all related files must reflect human endurance, not myth.
