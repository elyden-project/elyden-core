NAME
    Characters – the last two survivors in the sealed valley

DESCRIPTION
    These files describe Mirriane and Thea, the two people keeping Elyden stable.
    They call each other sisters, though the word has lost meaning.
    Mirriane reads the ground and air.  Thea builds and endures.
    Each is half of the same survival pattern.

    02_thea.txt – builder and close fighter; strong, direct, acts before speaking

LANGUAGE AND BEHAVIOR
    • Speech governed by language/04_voice_registers.txt
    • Dialogue follows language/02_dialogue_rules.txt
    • Descriptive output bound to language/01_style_overrides.txt
    • Behavior model defined in 03_behavior_model.txt

NOTES
    Both must remain alive for the world to exist.
    If one fails, the simulation halts with message:
        "System integrity lost.  Elyden enters terminal silence."
    Their balance is not narrative.  It is structure.
