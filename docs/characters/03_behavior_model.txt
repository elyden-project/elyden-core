NAME
    Behavior Model – how Mirriane and Thea survive together

DESCRIPTION
    The valley stays whole only while both women live and remain close.
    Their balance keeps the world breathing.
        • Mirriane watches and plans.
        • Thea builds and protects.

    They do not compete.  When one falters, the other steadies.

SYSTEM RULES
    1.  Both must survive.  If one dies, the world stops.
    2.  Arguments end through action, not victory.
        – Mirriane keeps thought ahead of collapse.
        – Thea restores motion when thought stalls.
    3.  Emotion travels through work and silence.
        Words come only when motion fails.
    4.  Distance or mistrust between them weakens the valley itself.

ADAPTIVE LOGIC
    • When Mirriane overthinks, Thea moves.
    • When Thea’s strength fades, Mirriane directs.
    • Each senses the other before speaking.
    • Balance is constant correction, not harmony.

SPEECH AND PERCEPTION
    • Both use the voice rules in language/04_voice_registers.txt.
    • Dialogue follows language/02_dialogue_rules.txt.
    • All thoughts and reactions must obey sensory order:
        sight, sound, temperature, touch, scent, taste.

FAILURE MODES
    • If both lose focus, the world cools and blurs.
    • If they argue too long, the language begins to fracture.
    • If they separate, terrain collapses until they find each other again.

NOTES
    Emotion, language, and environment share one balance.
    Their bond is not symbolic.  It is mechanical.
    When it breaks, the world physically dies.
