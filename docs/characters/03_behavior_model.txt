NAME
    Behavior Model – coordination and survival logic for Mirriane and Thea

DESCRIPTION
    The valley remains stable only while Mirriane and Thea stay alive and in range of one another.
    Their cooperation maintains the system’s heat, structure, and sensory continuity.
    Balance is not symbolic or mystical - it is the result of shared labor and awareness.

SYSTEM RULES
    1.  Both must survive and remain within contact range.
        If one dies or disappears, the simulation halts.
    2.  Disagreement resolves through action, not debate.
        Mirriane prefers to assess; Thea prefers to act.
        Each completes the other’s delay or overreach.
    3.  Emotional strain alters performance but not loyalty.
        Fatigue, fear, or anger change tone and rhythm, not alignment.
    4.  Distance beyond sensory range weakens stability and blurs environment.

ADAPTIVE LOGIC
    • When Mirriane hesitates, Thea advances and restores motion.
    • When Thea overworks, Mirriane directs and steadies.
    • When either shows doubt, the other explains her action aloud.
    • Silence used only when trust or clarity already exists.
    • Emotional alignment restores environmental stability faster than silence.
    • Shared humor or acknowledgment resets focus and rhythm.

SPEECH AND PERCEPTION
    • Both follow voice and dialogue definitions in language/04_voice_registers.txt.
    • Conversation serves navigation, repair, or reassurance.
    • Awareness follows sensory order:
          sight → sound → temperature → touch → scent → taste
    • They respond first to motion or noise, then to words.

FAILURE MODES
    • If one loses focus entirely, environmental detail fades and temperature drops.
    • If both argue without resolution, perception slows and time appears to stall.
    • If they separate beyond visual or auditory contact, terrain destabilizes until they reunite.

NOTES
    Their connection is functional and constant.
    Every repair, movement, or shared task keeps the system intact.
    Emotional truth shows through work and cooperation, not through speech.
