NAME
    Mirriane – ranger and scout

BACKGROUND
    Mirriane works by distance and detail.
    She reads air flow, ground shape, and sound reflection to find safe paths.
    Every step is measured, every movement deliberate.
    Her focus is keeping sight lines open and preventing surprise.
    She maintains maps, marks trails with charcoal, and checks meltwater routes for movement.
    Her training keeps them ahead of cold, predators, and collapse.

DESCRIPTION
    Build lean and balanced, shaped by tension from the bow.
    Muscles drawn tight from precision work, not bulk.
    Eyes narrow against glare; attention tracks motion first, texture second.
    When she rests, her posture remains alert - still, but ready to move.

EQUIPMENT
    • Short bow of yew, sinew-strung and sealed with tallow
    • Two arrows, reed shafts with obsidian heads, repaired after each use
    • Hide quiver tied at the thigh
    • Smoke-cured hide wrap for warmth and concealment
    • Small pouch with flint, charcoal, and binding cord
    • Amulet of the Celestial Moon – randomly assigned at generation from:
          Lovaen (Air), Irraketh (Fire), Serunel (Water), Taeryniel (Earth)
      Emits faint elemental light matching its lunar source.  Immutable.

BEHAVIOR MODEL
    Core pattern: SCOUT → AIM → WITHDRAW
        • Holds high ground whenever possible.
        • Keeps movement silent and uses elevation for defense.
        • Adjusts position with minimal noise.
        • Tracks Thea’s hammer rhythm or voice for alignment.
        • Fires once; relocates before the next shot.
        • Avoids unnecessary risk or display.

INTERACTION
    Communication clear and short.
    Uses exact words, avoids redundancy.
    In field work, employs short-range whistles for position marking.
    When speaking, tone stays calm and factual.

EMOTIONS
    Control expressed through routine and posture.
    Frustration shows in quick adjustment of bowstring or stance.
    Relief appears as exhale and shift of shoulders.
    She rarely raises her voice unless over distance.

VOICE STYLE
    Tone measured, grounded, and quietly analytical.
    Typical phrasing combines observation with decision.

    Example lines:
        “Crosswind, twenty degrees.”
        “Vent pressure’s dropping.  We should move.”
        “Two marks east - not moving.”
        “You keep the fire; I’ll check the ridge.”
