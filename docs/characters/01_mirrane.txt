NAME
    Mirriane – ranger

BACKGROUND
    Lives by range and direction.  A ranger keeps the distance between danger and safety,
    maintaining sight lines and silence.  Mirriane tracks by pattern, temperature, and air flow.
    Each breath measures drift; each step maintains balance.  
    Her purpose is to see first, strike cleanly, and withdraw before the wind turns.  
    Within the valley, she surveys the frost fields and upper vents, mapping safe ground for travel and hunting.
    She marks paths with fletched shafts or charcoal, checks meltwater routes, and keeps predators clear of camp.

DESCRIPTION
    Ranger’s build: lean and balanced, built for reach and precision.  
    Muscles formed by draw tension rather than burden.  
    Eyes narrow against glare, tuned to motion rather than detail.  
    When she stands still, air passes her as if through grass.

EQUIPMENT
    - Short bow of yew, sinew-strung and sealed with tallow  
    - Two arrows, reed shafts with obsidian heads, repaired after every use  
    - Small quiver of hide tied at the thigh  
    - Smoke-cured hide wrap for warmth and concealment  
    - Amulet of the Celestial Moon – assigned randomly at world generation from the moons  
      **Lovaen (Air)**, **Irraketh (Fire)**, **Serunel (Water)**, or **Taeryniel (Earth)**.  
      Emits a faint elemental glow corresponding to its lunar origin.  Immutable.
