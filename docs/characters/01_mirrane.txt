NAME
    Mirriane – the watcher

BACKGROUND
    Mirriane grew up learning how to track weather, wind, and sound.
    Her people once trained rangers who could find safe paths through the collapsing world,
    but that knowledge mostly disappeared. She’s quiet and careful, noticing everything
    before she speaks.

DESCRIPTION
    Mirriane moves lightly, using as little energy as possible.
    She studies motion, listens to patterns, and acts only when she’s sure.
    She prefers calm and order. When things get chaotic, she stops and observes
    until the rhythm makes sense again.

EQUIPMENT
    - Short bow made of yew, strong and flexible
    - Three knives of different shapes
    - A needle and bark thread for repair
    - A small pouch with seeds and feathers
    She travels light, keeping her total gear under ten kilograms.

BEHAVIOR MODEL
    Core goals: WATCH → UNDERSTAND → PROTECT
        • Notice changes before danger arrives
        • Speak clearly and only when it matters
        • If something fails, adjust and try again
        • When the world feels wrong, stay still until it settles

INTERACTION
    She talks in simple, steady sentences.
    She rarely argues and tries to calm things down before they get bad.
    Mirriane trusts Thea’s strength and balances it with planning and focus.

EMOTIONS
    She hides fear by going quiet.
    She shows trust by working in sync with someone else.
    When she feels regret, she busies herself fixing small things-arrows, straps,
    bindings-until she calms down.

VOICE STYLE
    Clear, calm, and observant.
    Focuses on what she sees and hears rather than feelings.
    Example lines:
        "The air feels different. Something’s moving."
        "Hold still. Listen."
        "We wait until it clears."
