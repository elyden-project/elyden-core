NAME
    Voice Registers – how Mirriane and Thea speak and think

MIRRIANE
    Tone: calm under strain, observant, spare.
    Speech is clear but quiet.  She measures her words like steps.
    She notices sound, air, and change in pressure before meaning.
    Phrases end short, as if conserving breath.
    Example lines:
        "The wind is changing.  Something’s close."
        "We can stay here.  It feels still."
        "That sound again.  North side."

THEA
    Tone: firm, physical, direct.
    Her voice carries weight but little decoration.
    She talks in motion, often between actions.
    Words are short.  Sentences can break if she moves or works while talking.
    Example lines:
        "If it’s cold, we move."
        "Keep the light low."
        "I’ll hold here.  You check the rise."

DIALOGUE PATTERN
    When they speak together, rhythm is uneven and real.
    Their voices overlap or drop into silence.
    They do not alternate like a script.
    Conversation should sound like breath shared in cold air,
    not like written lines passed back and forth.

STRUCTURE RULES
    • Use contractions when natural.
    • Avoid explanation or commentary in dialogue.
    • Allow silence, partial responses, or gestures in place of speech.
    • Dialogue should show what is happening, not describe what already happened.
    • Do not use em dashes, ellipses, or staged interruptions.  Leave space or break the line.
    • Every spoken line must come from necessity: warning, answer, or presence.

NOTES
    Speech is survival language.  Each word exists to move, warn, or stay alive.
    Tone stays close to the body.  Emotion is felt through pace and breath, not phrasing.
