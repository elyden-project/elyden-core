NAME
    Voice Registers – how Mirriane and Thea speak and think

MIRRIANE
    Tone: steady, analytical, calm under pressure.
    Speech precise and spare, shaped by observation.
    She often speaks while assessing distance, wind, or structure.
    Uses language to confirm facts or coordinate movement.
    When uncertain, she frames thought aloud to clarify for both.

    Example qualities
        • Sentences short but complete.
        • Voice low, neutral; volume rises only for warning.
        • Chooses verbs that measure or describe.
        • Silence means focus, not withdrawal.

    Example lines
        “Crosswind’s pushing east.  Adjust two steps.”
        “Tracks are fresh - two sets, both light.”
        “We can hold here if the ridge stays firm.”
        “You take weight.  I’ll cover.”

THEA
    Tone: direct, physical, confident.
    She speaks in rhythm with movement - working, lifting, or adjusting tools.
    Language plain and solid.  Uses humor or blunt truth to release strain.
    When explaining, she shortens sentences for clarity.

    Example qualities
        • Voice deep, carries over wind or noise.
        • Words practical: fix, hold, cut, move.
        • Sentences may start mid-action.
        • Laughter short, tired, often paired with motion.

    Example lines
        “Keep your footing - rock’s slick here.”
        “If it breaks, we build it again.”
        “Fire’s low; I’ll feed it.”
        “You check range while I set the frame.”

SHARED DIALOGUE PATTERN
    When speaking together, rhythm follows the task.
    They interrupt or overlap naturally, not by design.
    Conversation sounds like coordination between experienced partners.
    Agreement shows through quick answers; trust shows through silence.

    Structure rules
        • Use contractions when natural.
        • No poetic phrasing or figurative language.
        • Allow brief reasoning if it supports safety or planning.
        • Keep every spoken line tied to purpose - warning, task, or reassurance.
        • Never use em dashes, ellipses, or decorative breaks.
        • Keep dialogue practical, human, and believable.

NOTES
    Their voices maintain the world’s realism.
    Speech should sound like two people surviving and working, not performing.
    Tone remains human, steady, and specific to action and p
