NAME  
    deep_deciduous_forest_biome − dense, aged forest with decayed growth and limited light

DESCRIPTION  
    Deep deciduous forest is formed from older growth where broadleaf trees have grown large and close together.  
    The canopy filters out most sunlight, making the understory sparse but moist.  
    Leaf litter, rotwood, and moss cover most surfaces.  
    Trails are few, and direction is easily lost.  
    Water collects in hollows and between roots, though stagnant.

PROPERTIES  
    • visibility − very low (dense canopy, shadows)  
    • cover − near total (roots, brush, trunks)  
    • traversal − slow (rotwood, undergrowth, animal paths)  
    • heat retention − high (trapped moisture)  
    • elevation shift − mild (root risers, shallow depressions)  
    • water surface − pooled in pockets and pits

INORGANIC MATERIALS  
    • black loam  
    • rotten bark  
    • clay and rootstone  
    • fungal crusted branches  
    • decomposed mulch  
    • sediment seep

        • hazel — short, nut-bearing  
        • spindle — thin-stemmed, small red berries  
    HERBS  
        • wild mint — grows in damp pockets

FAUNA  
    INSECTS  
        • carrion beetle — feeds on rot, found under logs  
        • forest gnat — swarms in still air  
        • wood tick — clings to warm hosts  
        • ground spider — fast, hides under leaf litter  
    REPTILES & AMPHIBIANS  
        • grass snake — non-venomous, coils in moss  
        • fire salamander — nocturnal, moisture-bound  
    BIRDS  
        • tawny owl — roosts silently, hunts at night  
        • blackbird — alert forager, scratches leaf piles  
        • woodpecker — tree driller, loud echo  
        • nuthatch — tree creeper, feeds on bark insects  
    MAMMALS  
        • red fox — hunts rodents, avoids light  
        • badger — digs under roots, nocturnal  
        • hedgehog — insectivore, hides in brush  
        • roe deer — timid grazer, follows narrow paths  
        • brown bear — solitary omnivore, may occupy clearings

AGGRESSIVE FAUNA  
    • brown bear — charges if cornered or startled  
    • red fox — may bite if trapped  
    • carrion beetle — bites if handled directly
