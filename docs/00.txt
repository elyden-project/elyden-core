NAME  
    00 − master reference index of Elyden simulation source files

DESCRIPTION  
    This file maps all original content files (01–49) to their content domains,  
    supporting reclassification, renaming, and modular access.

FILE MAP  
    Index of canonical source files for Elyden survival simulation.  
    Each entry is sorted by page number, filename, and descriptive scope.  
    Filenames are system references only; page numbers are simulation-internal.
