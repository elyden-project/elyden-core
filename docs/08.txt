NAME  
    steep_hills_biome − elevated ridgelines with exposed mineral and tree growth

DESCRIPTION  
    Steep hills form from compacted sedimentary rock and exposed ridgelines.  
    Slopes range from sharp inclines to vertical crags with minimal stable footing.  
    Loose shale, gravel, and fractured stone dominate the terrain.  
    Tree growth is sparse but viable on certain ledges and terraces.  
    Wind exposure is constant; shade exists only along cliffside edges.

PROPERTIES  
    • visibility − limited by slope and rock formations  
    • cover − moderate (tree shadow, fold lines)  
    • traversal − difficult (slippage risk, incline strain)  
    • heat retention − low  
    • elevation shift − high  
    • water surface − absent (runoff only)

INORGANIC MATERIALS  
    • shale  
    • banded sandstone  
    • dry chalk  
    • iron flake  
    • quartz vein (small)  
    • obsidian splinter (rare)

FLORA  
    GRASSES  
        • windgrass — narrow, sharp-edged, non-edible  
    HERBS  
        • stonebloom — aromatic, inert  
        • cliff fennel — edible (cooked)  
    FUNGI  
        • ridge lichen — edible (scraped)  
        • black knot — toxic (cooked or raw)  
    TREES  
        • pinyon pine — hard, slow growth  
        • juniper — fibrous trunk, brittle limbs  
    SHRUBS & SUCCULENTS  
        • cliffbriar — thorny, moisture-retentive  
        • drybrush — low leaf yield, brittle

FAUNA  
    INSECTS  
        • shale wasp — aggressive if disturbed  
        • ridge ant — line carrier, non-aggressive  
    BIRDS  
        • raven — ground feeder  
        • mountain shrike — hunts small rodents  
    MAMMALS  
        • mountain goat — nimble, non-aggressive  
        • mountain lion — solitary ambush predator  
    REPTILES  
        • rock viper — heat-seeking, coiled under shadow  
    AMPHIBIANS  
        • none confirmed

AGGRESSIVE FAUNA  
    • cougar — stalks from higher elevation, ambushes if line-of-sight is broken  
    • shale wasp — swarms if nest disturbed  
    • pit viper — strikes if stepped near
