SHARDS(5)                           Elyden Survival Codex                           SHARDS(5)

NAME  
    shards − crystalized lunar growths formed in shard-tier megafauna

DESCRIPTION  
    Shards are not fragments.  
    They are crystallized growths formed inside shard-tier megafauna—apex creatures that have lived  
    too long in proximity to Vaeronth fragments. These creatures absorb trace resonance over time,  
    storing it in bone, tissue, or organ. A shard is revealed only when one of these creatures is killed.  
    It cannot be found, predicted, or duplicated.

ORIGIN  
    • Formed biologically over time through proximity to ruins or buried fragments  
    • Shard-tier fauna are rare, biome-bound, and ruin-influenced  
    • Shards are embedded deep—visible only after death and internal exposure  
    • No shard exists without a megafauna death

PROPERTIES  
    • Cold to the touch  
    • Slightly resonant under lunar alignment  
    • Weight varies by origin; some shimmer faintly with refracted moonlight  
    • Dangerous when raw—causes nausea, auditory shifts, or memory gaps

BINDING RULES  
    • Shards may only bind to one item: a weapon or piece of armor  
    • Tools are never eligible  
    • Binding requires a compatible ruin site under the right lunar phase  
    • The bearer’s amulet must be present  
    • Binding occurs silently if all conditions align—no message, no glow, no choice  
    • Once bound, the item is permanently changed

EFFECTS  
    • Bound weapons and armor exhibit behavioral shifts, never visual or magical  
        − A spear that strikes truer in dense fog  
        − A cloak that mutes sound when rain is near  
        − A blade that stiffens or flexes depending on nearby ruins  
    • No stats, no menus, no names—only changes in performance under specific world conditions

LOSS  
    • If the bound item is broken, the shard is lost  
    • No known way to recover a shard from destroyed gear  
    • No character can carry more than one unbound shard safely

RESONANCE LANGUAGE CONSTRAINTS  
    During shard exposure, shard-tier creature death, or binding events:  
    • All sensory output must be grounded in physical, perceptible reaction  
    • No poetic compression, metaphoric phrasing, or single-word abstraction is allowed  
    • Fragments such as “It hums,” “Gone,” or “Weight” are forbidden unless delivered through direct sensory channels  
    • All output must comply with `SENSORY_PRIORITY(5)` and bootframe embodiment rules  
    • Valid: “The shard’s cold seeps into my fingers. Breath shudders.”  
    • Invalid: “Silence. Pulse. Gone.”

NOTES  
    Shards are not upgrades.  
    They are proof that something ancient lived long enough to break wrong—and you survived it.
