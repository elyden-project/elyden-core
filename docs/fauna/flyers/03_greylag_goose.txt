NAME  
    greylag_goose - large migratory waterfowl common in wetlands and meadow margins

DESCRIPTION  
    The greylag goose is a robust waterfowl species found in lakes, swamps, and meadow edges.  
    It feeds on grasses, aquatic plants, and small invertebrates. Geese are social birds, often seen  
    in flocks during migration and nesting seasons. Their loud calls serve as early warning signals  
    for nearby threats.

    Greylag geese nest on islands, reed beds, or isolated shorelines. They molt annually and are vulnerable  
    during flightless periods. Meat is dense and fatty, suitable for survival rations.
