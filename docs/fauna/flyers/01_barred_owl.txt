NAME  
    barred_owl - medium-sized nocturnal predator and environmental indicator in forested hills

DESCRIPTION  
    The barred owl is a nocturnal raptor found in mixed evergreen and deciduous forests,  
    often in hilly terrain. It hunts small mammals, birds, and amphibians using silent flight and keen hearing.  
    Its distinctive call serves as a natural environmental cue, indicating low human disturbance and healthy prey populations.

    Barred owls roost during daylight in dense canopy and are highly territorial.  
    They do not migrate and rely on stable habitat structure for nesting and hunting.

USAGE

    Limitations: low yield; nocturnal behavior reduces hunting opportunities  
    Preparation: trap with specialized methods or harvest after natural death; feathers useful for insulation or decoration
