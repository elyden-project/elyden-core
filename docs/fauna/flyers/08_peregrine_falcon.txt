NAME  
    peregrine_falcon - fast aerial predator found in badlands and glacier zones

DESCRIPTION  
    The peregrine falcon is a medium-sized raptor known for its incredible diving speed and hunting prowess.  
    It preys primarily on medium-sized birds, capturing them in mid-air with swift strikes.  
    Peregrines nest on cliffs and rocky outcrops, favoring open landscapes like badlands and glacier margins.

    Their presence indicates healthy avian populations and open hunting grounds. Meat yield is minimal but feathers  
    are valued for crafting.

USAGE  
    Used as: indicator of avian prey abundance, source of feathers for crafting  
    Limitations: small meat yield; fast flight and wary nature reduce hunting success  
    Preparation: trap at nesting sites or collect feathers post-mortem; cook any meat thoroughly if consumed

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: badlands, glacier
