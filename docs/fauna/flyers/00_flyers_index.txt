NAME  
    flyers_index - winged fauna with navigational, environmental, or survival relevance

DESCRIPTION  
    Flyers are aerial organisms encountered across varied elevations and biomes.  
    Most are birds, though behavior and role vary by size, migratory pattern, or territorial range.  
    Some are trappable at rest or during low-flight intervals; others serve as signal or orientation markers.

    Yield may include meat, feathers, or bone. However, most flyer species are not primary food sources.  
    Movement often correlates with thermal shifts, predator avoidance, or seasonal transitions.

    Entry files document altitude behavior, landing conditions, and biome constraints.  
    Each species is grounded in real-world taxonomy. No fictional morphologies are used.
