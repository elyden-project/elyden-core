NAME  
    megafauna_index - rare solitary organisms of extreme scale and ecological dominance

DESCRIPTION  
    Megafauna are biologically extreme, cold-adapted organisms surviving in isolated zones  
    across the sealed valley. They exhibit solitary behavior, fixed territorial range, and  
    metabolic resilience to frozen terrain or geothermal transition bands.

    All species are grounded in Ice Age fossil record or derived from extant genera scaled  
    to plausible upper limits. Each is biologically self-consistent. No fantasy traits,  
    symbolic naming, or speculative hybrids are used.

    These organisms are always classified as Gigantic. Encounters are rare and dangerous.  
    Each entry specifies known biomes and behavior patterns. Hunting is not advised.
