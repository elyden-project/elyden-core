NAME  
    woolly_mammoth - colossal Ice Age herbivore adapted to tundra and frost sink biomes

DESCRIPTION  
    The woolly mammoth is a massive, shaggy-coated proboscidean with thick fur and long, curved tusks.  
    It grazes on grasses, shrubs, and low trees in cold tundra environments.  
    Mammoths migrate seasonally following forage availability and sheltering in geothermal transition zones.

    Their enormous size provides resilience against predators and environmental extremes.  
    Mammoth remains yield substantial meat, bone, and hide, but hunting is dangerous and requires planning.

USAGE  
    Used as: critical source of bulk meat, durable hide, bone tools, and fuel from fat reserves  
    Limitations: solitary behavior and size make hunting hazardous; requires coordinated effort  
    Preparation: hunt with large-scale traps; field dress and process with heavy tools; preserve hides in cold conditions

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: tundra, frost_sink, glacier

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Mammuthus primigenius
