NAME  
    lynx - solitary forest ambush predator adapted to cold terrain

DESCRIPTION  
    The lynx is a medium-sized feline with powerful legs, tufted ears, and thick insulating fur.  
    It hunts by stealth and sudden ambush, preying on hares, birds, and small grazers.  
    Prefers dense cover, rocky outcrops, and glacial fringe zones where it can move silently and unseen.

    Lynx are solitary and elusive, rarely vocal unless challenged.  
    Tracks are rounded and widely spaced, often found near prey corridors or stone breaks.  
    Its pelt is among the most valued for warmth due to density and weather resistance.
