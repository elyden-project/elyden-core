NAME  
    stoat - agile cold-adapted hunter of rodents and small birds

DESCRIPTION  
    The stoat is a tiny, fast-moving mustelid active across tundra and meadow terrain.  
    It preys on voles, eggs, and nesting birds, using burrows, snow tunnels, and rock gaps for cover.  
    In cold seasons, its fur shifts to pure white, making it difficult to detect in snow-covered ground.

    Stoats are solitary and highly territorial.  
    Their pelts are prized for trim and fine insulation, especially during winter molt.  
    Tracks are small and bounding, often found near field edge or stream burrows.

USAGE  
    Used as: fine pelt for glove or hood lining, light bone tools, and charm materials  
    Limitations: small yield; requires specific traps or winter tracking skill  
    Preparation: skin with curved blade; dry stretched flat; preserve fur density during storage
