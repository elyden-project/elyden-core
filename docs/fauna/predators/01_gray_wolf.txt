NAME  
    gray_wolf - territorial pack predator common to forests and plains

DESCRIPTION  
    The gray wolf is a social carnivore known for coordinated hunting and strong territorial patterns.  
    It preys on deer, smaller grazers, and carrion, often using pack movement to corner or exhaust targets.  
    Wolves communicate through scent, posture, and vocalization. Lone individuals may scavenge or test weaker prey.

    Signs of presence include clustered spoor, territorial marking, and sudden quiet among signals.  
    While direct confrontation is risky, wolves may be trapped, tracked, or baited if necessary.  
    Their pelts offer high insulation value and are commonly taken in winter months.
