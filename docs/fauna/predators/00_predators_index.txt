NAME  
    predators_index - active hunting fauna that stalk, ambush, or pursue prey

DESCRIPTION  
    Predators are carnivorous or omnivorous organisms that pursue live prey.  
    They exhibit territorial, solitary, or pack-based hunting behavior depending on species and biome.  
    Most represent direct threats to field survival and must be tracked or avoided.

    Presence is often indicated by silence among signal species, spoor, scent marks, or cached kills.  
    Encounters are typically non-recoverable without preparation or terrain advantage.  
    Some species can be baited, avoided, or forced into retreat; others will engage without hesitation.

    Predators are not hunted for resource yield in standard scenarios.  
    Engagement is discouraged unless driven by starvation, injury, or environmental constraint.  
    Entry files specify aggression logic, biome coverage, and avoidance protocols.
