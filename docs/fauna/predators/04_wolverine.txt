NAME  
    wolverine - aggressive small predator adapted to frozen highlands and evergreen forests

DESCRIPTION  
    The wolverine is a muscular, wide-ranging scavenger and predator.  
    Despite its small size, it exhibits intense aggression and can displace larger animals from kills.  
    It preys on weakened grazers, scavenges carcasses, and raids caches using strength and tenacity.

    Tracks are heavy for its size and often follow ridge lines or snow drift edges.  
    Dens are dug into tree roots or rock piles. Its pelt is extremely resistant to frost and moisture.

USAGE  
    Used as: high-performance pelt for outerwear trim or mitts, teeth for charms or bindings  
    Limitations: highly aggressive when cornered; not trap-reliable; best hunted by bait concealment  
    Preparation: skin with reinforced gloves; dry and stretch pelt carefully to retain texture
