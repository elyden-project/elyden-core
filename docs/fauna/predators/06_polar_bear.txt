NAME  
    polar_bear - massive arctic predator dominating ice shelf and glacial margins

DESCRIPTION  
    The polar bear is a solitary apex predator adapted to extreme cold and aquatic foraging.  
    It hunts seals, scavenges carcasses, and stalks across ice sheets and snowfields.  
    Its white coat and silent tread make it difficult to detect in open terrain.

    Encounters are rare but deadly. Polar bears do not fear humans and may pursue across long distances.  
    Their hides are thick, oil-rich, and resistant to wind and moisture. Flesh and fat provide emergency sustenance.

USAGE  
    Used as: extreme-weather pelt, bone for heavy tools, fat for fuel or sealant  
    Limitations: immense danger in open terrain; cannot be trapped reliably; must be baited or led into deadfall  
    Preparation: skin carefully to preserve hide integrity; fat must be rendered quickly to avoid spoilage

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: ice_shelf, glacier

SIZE  
    Massive

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Ursus maritimus
