NAME  
    fauna_index - overview of fauna classification by survival function

DESCRIPTION  
    Fauna within the sealed valley are grouped by behavioral role and survival impact.  
    No taxonomy is used. All names refer to real-world species or grounded variants.  
    Classification reflects field interaction, not biological lineage.

CATEGORY STRUCTURE  

    grazers/  
        Herbivores that feed on vegetation or low-growth flora.  
        Includes prey species used for meat, hide, or bone.  
        Behavior is non-aggressive unless provoked.

    predators/  
        Organisms that stalk or chase prey.  
        Includes solitary or territorial hunters.  
        Encounters may be lethal. Behavior varies by zone and season.

    scavengers/  
        Opportunists that consume carrion, waste, or kill remnants.  
        Presence may indicate recent kills or biome stress.  
        May interfere with stealth or storage.

    signals/  
        Small ambient organisms used to detect disruption or movement.  
        Includes birds, insects, and minor fauna with reliable behavioral shifts.  
        Not hunted. Used for navigation or hazard anticipation.

    aquatic/  
        Fauna residing in lakes, swamps, or flood basins.  
        Includes fish, amphibians, and semi-submerged foragers.  
        Yield and behavior vary with water temperature and flow.

    flyers/  
        Winged organisms. Includes raptors, ambient birds, and seasonal migrators.  
        Used for resource yield, navigation, or alarm behavior.  
        Generally difficult to hunt unless grounded.

    megafauna/  
        Gigantic apex organisms from pre-collapse ecosystems.  
        Extremely rare. High lethality.  
        Each specimen occupies a distinct territory. Avoid engagement.
