NAME  
    crayfish - small freshwater crustacean inhabiting lakes and swamps, used for protein and bait

DESCRIPTION  
    Crayfish are small, freshwater crustaceans that live in lakes, swamps, and slow-moving streams.  
    They feed on detritus, small invertebrates, and plant matter. Crayfish burrow into mud and hide under rocks or vegetation.  
    Their exoskeletons provide limited protection but are molted regularly.

    Crayfish are abundant in shallow water zones with ample cover. They are commonly trapped using baited cages or by hand.  
    Meat is delicate and rich in protein but should be cooked thoroughly.

USAGE  
    Used as: supplemental protein source, live or processed bait for fishing  
    Limitations: small size yields limited meat; molting cycle affects availability  
    Preparation: trap or catch by hand; remove shell if preferred; cook thoroughly before consumption

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: lake, swamp

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Faxonius virilis
