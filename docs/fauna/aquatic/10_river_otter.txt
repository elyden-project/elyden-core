DESCRIPTION  
    The river otter is a social, agile mammal found along lakeshores and floodplains.

    Otters are wary of humans and require stealth or traps for effective harvest.

    Limitations: elusive behavior complicates capture; requires specialized trapping  
    Preparation: trap near water edges; skin carefully to preserve fur; cook meat thoroughly
