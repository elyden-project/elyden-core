NAME  
    river_otter - medium-sized semi-aquatic mammal inhabiting lakes and flood hollows, valued for fur and meat

DESCRIPTION  
    The river otter is a social, agile mammal found along lakeshores and floodplains.  
    It feeds primarily on fish, amphibians, and crustaceans, using agile swimming and diving to capture prey.  
    Otters build dens near water and maintain scent-marked territories.

    Their dense, waterproof fur provides valuable insulation. Meat yield is moderate but nutritionally dense.  
    Otters are wary of humans and require stealth or traps for effective harvest.

USAGE  
    Used as: source of fur for insulation and waterproofing, and moderate protein supply  
    Limitations: elusive behavior complicates capture; requires specialized trapping  
    Preparation: trap near water edges; skin carefully to preserve fur; cook meat thoroughly

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: lake, flood_hollow

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Lontra canadensis
