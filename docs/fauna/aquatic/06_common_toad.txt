NAME  
    common_toad - resilient amphibian inhabiting wet slopes and flood hollows, used as supplemental protein

DESCRIPTION  
    The common toad is a terrestrial amphibian found near water bodies such as wetlands and moist slopes.  
    It feeds primarily on invertebrates and small insects. Toads secrete mild toxins through their skin,  
    which deters many predators. Their thick, warty skin provides protection and moisture retention.

    Toad meat can be consumed cautiously, typically after thorough cooking to avoid toxin effects.  
    They are captured using traps or by hand during nocturnal activity periods.

USAGE  
    Used as: supplemental meat source, small-game catch in wet habitats  
    Limitations: skin secretions require removal or thorough cooking; small size limits yield  
    Preparation: trap or hand-capture at night; skin carefully; cook thoroughly to neutralize toxins

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: wet_slope, flood_hollow

SCIENTIFIC NAME
