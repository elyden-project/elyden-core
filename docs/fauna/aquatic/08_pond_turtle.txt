DESCRIPTION  
    The pond turtle is a medium-sized freshwater turtle found in lakes, flood hollows, and slow-moving water.  
    It forages on aquatic plants, invertebrates, and carrion. The species basks on logs or banks to regulate body temperature.

    Meat is dense and nutritious but requires thorough cooking to avoid parasites.
