NAME  
    muskrat - small semi-aquatic rodent valued for fur and meat in wetland zones

DESCRIPTION  
    Muskrats inhabit marshes, lakes, and slow streams where they build burrows or lodges.  
    They feed on aquatic plants, roots, and occasionally small animals.  
    Muskrats are primarily nocturnal and are active year-round, using thick fur for insulation.

    Their pelts provide essential warmth in cold environments, while their meat is a moderate protein source.  
    Trapping muskrats is common, using baited snares or cage traps near feeding areas.

USAGE  
    Used as: fur source for insulation, meat for survival protein  
    Limitations: small size yields limited meat; trapping requires knowledge of habitat  
    Preparation: trap near vegetation zones; skin carefully to preserve fur; cook meat thoroughly

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: lake, swamp
