NAME  
    aquatic_index - water-bound and semi-aquatic fauna inhabiting lakes, swamps, and runoff zones

DESCRIPTION  
    Aquatic fauna include fish, amphibians, reptiles, and semi-submerged mammals.  
    These species reside in or near water bodies and are encountered along shorelines,  
    flood zones, or submerged terrain. Most are forageable using traps, spears, or direct hand retrieval.

    Movement and yield vary with water temperature, flow, and clarity.  
    Some species are nocturnal or responsive to geothermal cycles.  
    Presence may indicate water stability, forage density, or surface disruption.

    Entry files document harvest method, biome constraints, and behavioral rhythm.  
    All organisms are grounded in real-world analogs. No symbolic or hybrid species are used.
