NAME  
    freshwater_eel - elongated nocturnal predator inhabiting swampy and slow-moving waters

DESCRIPTION  
    The freshwater eel is a slender, snake-like fish that favors swamp and lake margins with dense cover.

    Their skin is slimy and tough, requiring thorough cleaning before consumption.

    Eels provide a rich, fatty meat valuable for survival nutrition. Their slippery bodies  
    make capture challenging, commonly requiring specialized traps or hand retrieval.

USAGE  
    Used as: fatty protein source, high-calorie catch for extended energy needs  
    Limitations: requires careful handling to remove slime; capture methods are specialized  
    Preparation: trap or snare in cover zones; skin thoroughly; gut and clean before cooking
