NAME  
    freshwater_eel - elongated nocturnal predator inhabiting swampy and slow-moving waters

DESCRIPTION  
    The freshwater eel is a slender, snake-like fish that favors swamp and lake margins with dense cover.  
    Primarily active at night, it preys on small fish, amphibians, and invertebrates.  
    Eels migrate seasonally to spawning grounds, often requiring unobstructed waterways.  
    Their skin is slimy and tough, requiring thorough cleaning before consumption.

    Eels provide a rich, fatty meat valuable for survival nutrition. Their slippery bodies  
    make capture challenging, commonly requiring specialized traps or hand retrieval.

USAGE  
    Used as: fatty protein source, high-calorie catch for extended energy needs  
    Limitations: requires careful handling to remove slime; capture methods are specialized  
    Preparation: trap or snare in cover zones; skin thoroughly; gut and clean before cooking

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: swamp, lake

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Anguilla rostrata
