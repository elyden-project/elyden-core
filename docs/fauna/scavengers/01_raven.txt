DESCRIPTION  
    The raven is a large, black-feathered corvid known for problem-solving and memory.  
    It frequents disturbed terrain and kill sites, often appearing shortly after predator departure.  
    Ravens scavenge flesh, bone fragments, and bait remnants. They also cache food in tree hollows or debris.

    Ravens travel in pairs or small groups and may follow humans discreetly.  
    Recognized by sharp croaks, wide wing span, and soaring spiral movement.
