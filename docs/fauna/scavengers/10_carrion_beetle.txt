NAME  
    carrion_beetle - decomposer insect active in decay-rich swamp and frost zones

DESCRIPTION  
    The carrion beetle is a small, hard-shelled insect that feeds on decaying flesh,  
    bone marrow, and organic waste. It is among the first responders to exposed carcasses,  
    tunneling into soft tissue and laying eggs in sinew or muscle pockets.

    Its presence signals advanced decomposition and microbial onset.  
    Beetles operate in clusters beneath remains or shallow cover.  
    Wing casings are dark, ridged, and resilient. Activity is low during freeze, high in thaw and saturation.

USAGE  
    Used as: bait attractant for trapcraft; locational signal for marrow-bearing remains;  
    in extreme scarcity, dried and crushed for protein supplementation  
    Limitations: minimal yield; risk of spoilage and contamination; must be processed separately from food stores  
    Preparation: gather with bark scoop or ash pan; dry thoroughly in shaded airflow; store sealed

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: swamp, frost_sink

SIZE  
    Tiny

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Nicrophorus vespilloides
