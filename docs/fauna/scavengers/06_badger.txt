NAME  
    badger - solitary digger and scavenger active across plains and low hills

DESCRIPTION  
    The badger is a stocky, clawed mammal that forages alone for insects, carrion, and root bulbs.  
    It excavates burrows and scrap dens with powerful forelimbs and avoids conflict through evasion or sudden aggression.  
    Active during twilight or overcast periods, it is rarely seen in open daylight.

    Tracks show low, wide spacing with deep front claw imprints.  
    Signs include overturned turf, scattered shells, and shallow dig lines near carrion fields.  
    Badgers avoid noise and respond poorly to sudden movement.

USAGE  
    Used as: compact pelt for mitts or wrap trim; teeth or claws for charms and tool grip; bait for predators  
    Limitations: aggressive when cornered; may destroy trap lines if improperly baited  
    Preparation: skin while fresh; claws must be removed with joint intact; dry hide away from sun

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: plains, hills

    Small

SCIENTIFIC NAME
