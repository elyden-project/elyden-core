NAME  
    scavengers_index - opportunistic fauna that feed on carrion, waste, or field residue

DESCRIPTION  
    Scavengers are non-predatory organisms that consume decaying material, discarded remains,  
    or abandoned field kill. Most avoid conflict and operate on the margins of active zones.  
    Their presence often signals recent death, biome stress, or predatory activity.

    Scavengers are typically nocturnal or crepuscular. Tracks may be shallow, inconsistent,  
    or overlaid with prey prints. Behavioral patterns include delayed approach,  
    object interference, or trap theft. Visibility is low; audio signals may be masked.

    These species are rarely hunted. Value lies in observation, bait control, and environmental read.  
    Entry files document interaction logic, yield (if applicable), and terrain disruption risk.
