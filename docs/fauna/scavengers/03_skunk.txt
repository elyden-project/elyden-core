NAME  
    skunk - scent-defensive scavenger active in forest margins and meadow zones

DESCRIPTION  
    The skunk is a small, slow-moving omnivore recognized by its bold stripe and potent chemical defense.

    Mostly nocturnal, it investigates open dens, overturned traps, and decaying matter in low-traffic areas.

    Tracks are narrow with arched claws. Presence often betrayed by odor trace before visual contact.  
    Dens are shallow burrows or sheltered under roots and debris.  
    Rarely aggressive unless startled or confined.
