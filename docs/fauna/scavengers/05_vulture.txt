NAME  
    vulture - thermal-gliding carrion bird found in ash fields and wet slopes

DESCRIPTION  
    The vulture is a large, bald-headed bird specialized in locating and consuming carrion.  
    It soars at high altitudes, scanning for carcasses and predator kills.  
    Feeds communally when safe, but flees rapidly if approached.

    Presence signals exposed remains or biome stress.  
    Vultures roost on high perches or stone outcrops, descending only after scent or signal confirms safety.  
    Flight pattern is slow and circling, often used to locate scavenging zones from afar.

USAGE
