NAME  
    striped_hyena - nocturnal bone-scavenger active along volcanic margins and badland slopes

DESCRIPTION  
    The striped hyena is a medium-sized scavenger with powerful jaws and a coarse, bristled mane.  
    It feeds primarily on sinew, cartilage, and marrow from long-abandoned kills.  
    Prefers isolation, often trailing predators to access remains once danger has passed.

    Tracks are broad with visible claw impressions and a loping rear-weighted gait.  
    Dens are shallow burrows or crevices in ash deposits and eroded rock.  
    Activity is marked by scattered bone fragments, dragged remains, and suppressed field noise.

USAGE  
    Used as: environmental indicator for stale kills or carrion zones; hide usable if cleaned thoroughly  
    Limitations: difficult to approach without alert; poor yield unless skinned immediately  
    Preparation: avoid spooking into spray-marking; clean hide aggressively; bones may be salvageable

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: volcanic_slope, badlands

SIZE  
    Medium

SCIENTIFIC NAME
