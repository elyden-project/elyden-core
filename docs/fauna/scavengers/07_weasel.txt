NAME  
    weasel - swift opportunistic scavenger active in open fields and low vegetation

DESCRIPTION  
    The weasel is a tiny, fast-moving carnivore that feeds on rodents, insects, and small carcasses.  
    It darts through grass, burrows, or brush piles and may enter traps or dens in search of remains.  
    Highly alert and territorial despite its size, it is often missed during daylight observation.

    Tracks are minimal and erratic.  
    Weasels operate close to the ground and leave behind drag traces, fur tufts, or disturbed surface soil.  
    Scent is light but persistent. Their activity can compromise bait or signal prey depletion.

USAGE  
    Used as: fine fur for insulation lining; sinew or whiskers for trigger fibers; minor bait scavenger indicator  
    Limitations: low yield; easily escapes basic traps; presence often confused with signal species  
    Preparation: skin delicately along spine; dry flat in cool air to preserve fur

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: meadow, plains

SIZE  
    Tiny

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Mustela nivalis
