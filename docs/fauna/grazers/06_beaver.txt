NAME  
    beaver - medium-sized semi-aquatic rodent known for dam-building and fur

DESCRIPTION  
    Beavers inhabit lakes, rivers, and flood hollows, constructing dams and lodges from wood and mud.  
    They feed on bark, aquatic plants, and tree shoots. Beavers have large incisors adapted for felling trees, which influence local ecology significantly.

    Their dense, waterproof fur is highly valued for insulation, and their meat provides a moderate protein source.  
    Beavers are primarily nocturnal and cautious around human activity.

USAGE  
    Used as: source of insulating fur, moderate meat supply, ecological engineer indicators  
    Limitations: requires trapping knowledge; nocturnal habits reduce daytime availability  
    Preparation: trap near water activity; skin carefully to preserve fur; cook meat thoroughly

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: lake, flood_hollow
