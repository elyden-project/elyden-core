NAME  
    musk_ox - large tundra grazer with thick insulating coat, adapted for cold environments

DESCRIPTION  
    Musk oxen are massive herbivores native to tundra and frost sink biomes.  
    They possess a dense undercoat called qiviut, which provides exceptional insulation.  
    Musk oxen graze on grasses, mosses, and lichens, often forming defensive circles  
    against predators. Their horns are curved and robust, used in intraspecific combat.

    Musk oxen are typically found in small herds and migrate seasonally within the valley.  
    Their slow movement and heavy build make them vulnerable to coordinated hunting.  
    Fur and hide are valuable for warmth, while meat is rich and substantial.

USAGE  
    Used as: high-calorie meat source, insulated hide for cold weather clothing, horn tools  
    Limitations: difficult to approach due to herd defense; requires strong weapons or traps  
    Preparation: coordinated hunt recommended; skin to preserve fur layers; cook meat thoroughly

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: tundra, frost_sink

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Ovibos moschatus
