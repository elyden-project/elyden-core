NAME  
    snowshoe_hare - small seasonal grazer used for meat, hide, and trap calibration

DESCRIPTION  
    Snowshoe hares are fast-moving, cold-adapted lagomorphs found in forest and meadow  
    terrain. Their large hind feet distribute weight for traversal across snow, and their  
    coat shifts from brown to white with season, aiding in camouflage. They are a primary  
    small-game target and foundational to basic trap systems.

    Snowshoe hares are solitary and crepuscular. They rest in shallow depressions and  
    emerge to forage on twigs, bark, grasses, or low shoots. Movement is erratic under  
    threat. Tracks are easily identified by rear-foot spread and bounding patterns.  
    Yield is limited, but recovery is simple. Hide is thin but useful for cold-layer patching.

USAGE  
    Used as: field meat source, hide for insulation patches, trap calibration target  
    Limitations: small size limits yield; fragile hide requires careful processing  
    Preparation: trap or stalk; skin promptly; dry hide flat; cook meat thoroughly

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: meadow, mixed_forest

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Lepus americanus
