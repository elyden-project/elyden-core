NAME  
    grazers_index - non-predatory herbivorous fauna used for food, hide, or field tracking

DESCRIPTION  
    Grazers are herbivorous animals that feed on grasses, bark, aquatic plants, or ground flora.  
    They do not pursue prey and are not inherently aggressive.  
    Most are hunted for meat, hide, or field material, and are ranked by yield, behavior, and risk.

    Movement is terrain-dependent. Some species migrate seasonally across multiple biomes.  
    Others are solitary and territorial. Sound, track depth, and pellet morphology are used  
    to confirm presence in low-visibility zones. Trapping, stalking, or cooperative pursuit  
    are primary harvest methods. Entry files note weapon compatibility and dressing logic.

    Species range from trap-compatible small mammals to large herd-yielding ruminants.  
    Each exhibits real-world behavior and survival-relevant traits.  
    No symbolic naming or invented physiology is used.
