NAME  
    chickadee - vocal canopy bird used to gauge subfreezing air and static pressure zones

DESCRIPTION  
    The chickadee emits a two-note call that shortens with cold and sharpens under pressure drop.  
    Its presence in evergreen forest indicates stable cover; abrupt silence or high clustering  
    signals overhead movement or predator treeline breach.

    Active during early light and midday. Travels in small groups between low branches.  
    Frequently observed during foraging bursts or canopy rests.

USAGE  
    Used as: call modulation tracker for pressure, predator, or skyborne shift  
    Limitations: soft call may be masked by snow drift or canopy creak; requires close listening  
    Observation: note change in call spacing, tone compression, or synchronized hush across zone

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: evergreen_forest
