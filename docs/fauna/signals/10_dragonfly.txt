NAME  
    dragonfly - aerial hover insect used to mark water purity and air stratification

DESCRIPTION  
    The dragonfly glides and hovers in still air over clean water margins.  
    It appears only when aquatic microclimate, sunlight, and wind calm intersect.  
    Disappearance signals turbidity, pollutant bloom, or thermal disturbance.

    Most active in daylight with high visibility.  
    Resting occurs on reeds or stones between bursts of linear flight.

USAGE  
    Used as: water-edge indicator of purity and air balance; loss implies weather, flow, or chemical shift  
    Limitations: seasonal; absent in high wind or over darkened pools  
    Observation: track flight height, orbit pattern, and abrupt dispersal across clustered surface zones

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: lake, swamp

SIZE  
    Tiny

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Anax junius
