NAME  
    signals_index - ambient fauna whose presence, silence, or behavior signals environmental change

DESCRIPTION  
    Signal species are not hunted. They serve as indirect indicators of threat proximity,  
    weather shift, territorial disruption, or biome transition. These fauna are passive,  
    small, and often vocal. Silence, altered movement, or absence may carry greater  
    weight than direct observation.

    Signal behavior is used to plan shelter, assess danger, or confirm movement corridors.  
    Entries are selected for ecological reliability, biome specificity, and pattern clarity.  
    Each species is native to the sealed valley and does not serve as direct resource yield.

    Entry files document sound profile, disturbance response, and observational thresholds.  
    Their role is to inform-not to engage.
