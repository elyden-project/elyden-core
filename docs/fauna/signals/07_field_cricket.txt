NAME  
    field_cricket - rhythmic ground insect used to detect surface vibration and temperature plateau

DESCRIPTION  
    The field cricket produces a steady chirp by wing stridulation, rising in frequency with warmth.  
    Chirping halts with footstep vibration, approaching fauna, or rapid ambient shift.  
    Absence of sound may indicate predator presence, seismic instability, or nocturnal wind shift.

    Found beneath leaf litter, soil cracks, or along stone edge.  
    Sound is clearest at dusk and tapers with cold onset or surface moisture.

USAGE  
    Used as: vibration alert for ground movement or transition; temperature stability proxy during dusk halt  
    Limitations: can be masked by wind or overrun by other insect species  
    Observation: listen for pattern dropouts, sector silence, or multi-node offset

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: meadow, hills

SIZE  
    Tiny

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Gryllus campestris
