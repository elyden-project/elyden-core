NAME  
    woodpecker - percussive signal bird used to detect ambient calm and tree health

DESCRIPTION  
    The woodpecker generates irregular tapping patterns as it probes for insects beneath bark.  
    Activity resumes only when ambient conditions stabilizeâ€”calls cease during predator movement,  
    wind stress, or subcanopy vibration. Percussion clarity reflects air density and canopy stillness.

    Most active during early daylight. Often solitary.  
    Found in hardwood trunks or deadfall remains. Sound carries well in deciduous terrain.

USAGE  
    Used as: indicator of biome calm, canopy structure, or sublayer disturbance  
    Limitations: sound range varies with wind; may be confused with structural creak or stone shift  
    Observation: note pause intervals, directionality of taps, or zone-to-zone silence gaps
