NAME  
    tree_frog - vocal amphibian used to assess humidity and lowland air shifts

DESCRIPTION  
    The tree frog emits a pulsing trill that rises in frequency with heat and moisture.  
    Its call is a primary sound layer in wet biomes and diminishes sharply before cold fronts,  
    predator proximity, or ambient pressure drops. Silence from frog clusters often precedes storm onset.

    Found clinging to reeds, bark, or stone near pooled water.  
    Active primarily at dusk and after rainfall. Movement is minimal; most detection is acoustic.

USAGE  
    Used as: ambient indicator for rain onset, lowland thermal change, or swamp predator presence  
    Limitations: call may be masked by wind; overlapping sound with other amphibians  
    Observation: noted for abrupt call cut-off, staggered timing, or lack of nightly return

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: swamp, wet_slope

SIZE  
    Tiny

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Hyla versicolor
