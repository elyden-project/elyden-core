NAME  
    cicada - seasonal drone emitter used to monitor heat stability and canopy silence

DESCRIPTION  
    The cicada produces a high-volume, continuous drone during warm stable periods.  
    Its sound ceases immediately with sudden shade, wind drop, or predator disturbance.  
    Silence is a key indicator of thermal collapse or tree-line movement.

    Found on tree trunks, bark splits, or within leaf clusters.  
    Activity peaks midday and vanishes at dusk. Easily masked by high wind or rain.

USAGE  
    Used as: ambient temperature floor indicator; drone cutoff used to track arboreal threat proximity  
    Limitations: seasonal; absent during cold cycle or after heavy weather disruption  
    Observation: watch for patterned cutout, fragmented return, or asymmetric canopy silence

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: deciduous_forest, mixed_forest

SIZE  
    Tiny
