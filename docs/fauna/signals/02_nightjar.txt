NAME  
    nightjar - dusk-calling ground bird used to mark calm atmospheric conditions

DESCRIPTION  
    The nightjar produces a continuous, low-pitched churr during twilight hours.  
    Its call emerges only in still air and fades entirely during wind, predatory movement,  
    or rapid barometric fluctuation. Silence often signals biome tension or sudden field pressure.

    Ground-roosting and camouflaged, it is rarely seen in motion.  
    Most active in open plains and meadow zones with clear acoustic range.

USAGE  
    Used as: dusk-phase environmental stabilizer; loss of call signals thermal drop, predator pass, or biome shift  
    Limitations: highly sensitive to human presence; difficult to differentiate from terrain if flushed  
    Observation: track onset and cessation timing; monitor spatial gaps in overlapping call zones

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: plains, meadow

SIZE  
    Small

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Caprimulgus europaeus
