NAME  
    bat - nocturnal flyer used to confirm insect bloom and thermal inversion

DESCRIPTION  
    The bat emerges at dusk to feed on airborne insects along thermal plumes and cliff edges.  
    Its erratic flight path reveals rising heat or wind troughs invisible from ground level.  
    Absence during still air may signal pre-storm barometric inversion or disrupted food layer.

    Found roosting in caves, overhangs, and glacial crevices.  
    Activity begins shortly after light fall and ceases near temperature floor.

USAGE  
    Used as: motion cue for airborne insect phase; indicator of dusk wind corridor and vertical uplift  
    Limitations: difficult to track visually; silent in motion; behavior affected by sudden cold shifts  
    Observation: note flight density, orientation, and vertical zone consistency after sunset

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: frost_sink, glacier

SIZE  
    Tiny

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Myotis lucifugus
