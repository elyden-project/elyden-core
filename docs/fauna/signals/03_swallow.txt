NAME  
    swallow - aerial insectivore used to detect wind shifts and barometric change

DESCRIPTION  
    The swallow is a fast, looping flyer that feeds on insects over water and open terrain.  
    Flight altitude lowers before storms or high-pressure collapse.  
    Sudden absence from lake zones often precedes rain or cold front movement.

    Typically nests in rock faces or abandoned structures.  
    Groups disperse widely in clear weather and concentrate tightly before system shifts.

USAGE  
    Used as: real-time marker for wind direction, storm onset, and low thermal drift  
    Limitations: difficult to track individually; requires wide visibility for flight path assessment  
    Observation: monitor density, elevation, and direction changes during late daylight hours

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: hills, lake

SIZE  
    Small

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Hirundo rustica
