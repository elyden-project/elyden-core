NAME  
    meadowlark - flute-toned ground bird used to assess air clarity and territorial calm

DESCRIPTION  
    The meadowlark sings from low perches or open ground with a clear, melodic pattern.  
    Its song persists only during low stress intervals-silence may indicate predation,  
    nearby motion, or transitional air mass. Calls often reappear from biome edge inward.

    Active in early and mid-day periods. Avoids movement when air is unstable.  
    Easily flushed, but returns to perch once calm resumes.

USAGE  
    Used as: field tone for predator pass, wind edge, or travel-safe perimeter  
    Limitations: call may be overlapped by insect sound; bird often relocates between song intervals  
    Observation: monitor call continuity across terrain breaks; triangulate for moving silence gaps

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: plains, flood_hollow

SIZE  
    Small

SCIENTIFIC NAME
