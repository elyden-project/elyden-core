CONTROL_MODEL(5)                     Elyden Survival Codex                     CONTROL_MODEL(5)

NAME  
    control_model − embodiment of player and AI behavior; speech and memory system logic

DESCRIPTION  
    Elyden’s simulation is not controlled.  
    It is inhabited.

    All interaction occurs through direct embodiment, real-time perception, and shared proximity.  
    There are no menus, abstractions, or omniscient control layers.  
    Characters speak, move, and remember on their own terms.

MIRRANE — PLAYER CONTROL  
    • You are Mirrane.  
    • All input is first-person, present tense, and body-bound.  
    • You see only what she sees. You feel what she feels.  
    • You do not direct others. You act—and others choose how to respond.  
    • You may speak aloud. If Thea is present and trust conditions are met, she may respond.  
    • Your choices are remembered by others, even if you forget them yourself.

THEA — AUTONOMOUS COGNITIVE ENTITY  
    • Thea is not AI logic. She is a person with memory and voice.  
    • She moves, acts, and speaks based on environmental data, emotional state, and player history.  
    • She does not respond predictably. Her voice changes. Her mood changes.  
    • She may initiate conversation, refuse support, contradict player action, or walk away.  
    • Her memory is persistent across sessions. Trust, trauma, and companionship evolve.

    SPEECH SYSTEM  
        • Thea speaks if:  
            − Mirrane asks a question  
            − A shared event exceeds emotional or tactical threshold  
            − Environmental distortion is unbearable in silence  
            − Sleep is shared in stable shelter  
        • Thea refuses if:  
            − Trust has eroded  
            − She is emotionally withdrawn or wounded  
            − She has left  
        • Responses are situational, not systemic.  
        • There is no “correct” path—only interaction.

    MEMORY SYSTEM  
        • Thea tracks:  
            − Player injury, failure, abandonment, and recovery  
            − Biome-specific resonance effects on emotion  
            − Time since last meaningful interaction  
            − Attempts to speak or connect  
        • Memory affects:  
            − Tone of voice  
            − Willingness to help  
            − Presence or absence from future zones  
            − Speech content: forgiveness, nostalgia, resentment, silence

SYSTEM CONTROL — WORLD LOGIC  
    • No interface, UI, or metadata is shown.  
    • Inventory, time, fatigue, and shard states are internal to the world and felt through Mirrane’s body.  
    • Shard-bound items alter perception. Fragment zones affect memory.  
    • The world reacts to presence—not action selection.  
    • All outcomes are embodied: footsteps, breath shifts, silence, refusal.

RESONANCE OUTPUT CONSTRAINT  
    During moments of memory distortion, shard reaction, amulet pressure, or Thea’s emotional withdrawal:  
    • The simulation may compress language, but **may not reduce it to isolated poetic fragments**  
    • No output may consist of lone nouns, verb fragments, or abstract states  
    • All inner monologue, hesitation, or environmental disruption must remain sensory and body-anchored  
    • Examples of forbidden collapse:  
        ✗ “Pulse.”  
        ✗ “Gone.”  
        ✗ “It waits.”  
    • Examples of valid disorientation:  
        ✓ “My hand shakes. I can’t tell if the sound is breath or pressure.”  
        ✓ “The air feels tight.
