NAME  
    deciduous_forest_biome − seasonal broadleaf terrain with soft undergrowth and high forage yield

DESCRIPTION  
    This forest features broadleaf canopy that shifts with the seasons.  
    Spring and summer provide high leaf density; autumn and winter expose the floor and sky.  
    The terrain is soft and loamy, with scattered saplings, fallen logs, and leaf litter.  
    Light fluctuates sharply across the year. Animal trails are common across root networks.

    • traversal − lightly impeded (roots, leaf piles)  
    • heat retention − moderate  
    • elevation shift − minor  
    • water surface − temporary (post-rain collection)
