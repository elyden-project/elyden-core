NAME  
    wild_sorrel - tangy leaf plant high in moisture and trace minerals

DESCRIPTION  
    Wild sorrel is a low-growing herbaceous plant with soft, arrow-shaped leaves.  
    It thrives in disturbed soil, meadows, and light-exposed clearings.  
    The leaves have a sharp, lemon-like flavor due to oxalic acid, making them  
    useful in small quantities for appetite stimulation and hydration.  
    Though nutritious, sorrel should not be consumed in large amounts over time  
    due to its mild anti-nutritional effects.

    Grows in clustered rosettes with smooth, bright green leaves and thin stems.  
    Most tender when harvested early in the season. Often found near stones or  
    along the edge of grass zones where tree cover breaks.

USAGE  
    Used as: chewable moisture source, stimulant forage, tea base for fatigue  
    Limitations: high quantities may impair mineral absorption over time  
    Preparation: rinse thoroughly; consume raw, steep into infusion, or dry in single layers

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: meadow, plains

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Rumex acetosa
