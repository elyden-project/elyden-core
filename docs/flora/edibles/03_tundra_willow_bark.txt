NAME  
    tundra_willow_bark - fibrous bark with trace sugar and survival fiber

DESCRIPTION  
    A low, shrubby form of willow found in permafrost zones and glacial margins.  
    Its bark can be stripped in narrow coils and chewed for limited nutritional value,  
    offering trace sugars and fibrous bulk to delay starvation symptoms. The bark has  
    a bitter flavor and slightly astringent quality. Though not a primary food source,  
    it remains one of the few edible materials available in cold barren zones.

    Growth is sprawling and close to the ground. Leaves are narrow and sparse.  
    Bark is smooth when young, darkens and roughens with age. Best gathered from  
    younger stems near thaw pockets.

USAGE  
    Used as: emergency chew fiber to suppress hunger and provide minimal energy  
    Limitations: not a long-term food source; bitterness may cause discomfort  
    Preparation: strip bark in coils with blade or fingernail; chew raw or dry for later use

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: tundra, glacier

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Salix arctica
