NAME  
    alpine_bistort - starchy mountain plant with edible root and shoot

DESCRIPTION  
    Alpine bistort is a short, hardy perennial found in cold alpine and tundra regions.  
    It produces a thick, knotted root rich in starch, and a small pink or white flower  
    spike on a simple upright stem. The root is the primary food source, dug and  
    boiled or dried into meal. Young leaves are edible raw but become tough with age.  
    The plant grows in clusters, often near glacial margins or exposed stone breaks.

    It tolerates frost and poor soil, relying on short growing windows and stored energy.  
    The root can be mistaken for similar plants but has a distinctive pinkish tone  
    and knotty segments. Difficult to harvest in frozen soil, but high in survival value  
    due to its carbohydrate density and cold resilience.

USAGE  
    Used as: boiled starch source, dried fallback ration, or meal additive  
    Limitations: root is difficult to extract from frozen or compacted ground  
    Preparation: dig root with blade or spike, scrub clean, boil until soft or dry and grind

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: tundra, glacier

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Bistorta vivipara
