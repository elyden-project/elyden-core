NAME  
    hazelnuts - high-fat seasonal nut from deciduous shrub

DESCRIPTION  
    Hazelnuts grow on compact, multi-stemmed shrubs found in forest margins and  
    temperate woodlands. The nuts form inside fibrous outer husks and hard inner shells.  
    When fully ripe, they fall to the ground and can be collected for their high  
    fat and caloric content. Hazelnuts can be eaten raw, roasted, or ground into  
    paste or flour. Their oil content makes them valuable for survival scenarios  
    requiring dense energy with minimal volume.

    The plant has rounded, serrated leaves and produces catkins in early spring.  
    Nuts ripen in late season. Squirrels and foragers often compete for fallen yield.  
    Best collected after husks begin to dry but before shell rot sets in.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: roasted and stored as travel ration; also ground into mash  
    Thea: crushed and added to composite meal blends or bait materials  
    Preparation: remove outer husk, crack shell with tool, dry kernel for storage or roast immediately
