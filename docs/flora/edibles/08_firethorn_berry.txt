NAME  
    firethorn_berry - clustered red fruit from thorn-bearing scrub

DESCRIPTION  
    Firethorn is a dense, thorn-covered shrub that produces small red to orange berries  
    in tightly packed clusters. It grows along disturbed slopes, rocky margins, and  
    post-burn zones where undergrowth is sparse. The berries are high in moisture  
    and carbohydrates but mildly irritating when raw. In small quantities, they are  
    safe; larger amounts may cause stomach upset unless cooked or dried.

    Shrubs can grow over two meters in height. Thorns are sharp and rigid,  
    making harvest hazardous without gloves or a stripping cloth. The plant  
    also serves as a natural barrier, often used instinctively by animals  
    for cover or nesting protection.

USAGE  
    Used as: forage fruit for hydration and sugar; dried additive for ration mix or bait paste  
    Limitations: mildly irritating if consumed raw in excess; thorns complicate harvesting  
    Preparation: strip berry clusters with cloth or blade; cook or dry to reduce astringency

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: ash_field, evergreen_forest, wet_slope

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Pyracantha coccinea
