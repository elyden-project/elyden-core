NAME  
    bluegrass_seeds - clustered grass seed used for coarse meal and ration filler

DESCRIPTION  
    Bluegrass is a common wild grass forming dense mats in open terrain.  
    During late-season dry periods, its upper stalks develop compact seed heads  
    that can be stripped and processed into a coarse, low-oil meal. Though not  
    calorie-rich, the seeds offer bulk and can extend limited rations.  
    Most effective when ground and cooked into paste or dry cakes.

    Growth occurs in patches across open meadows and light wood margins.  
    Blades are narrow and deep green. Seed heads emerge upright, branching  
    in narrow fans. Harvesting is done by stripping the upper stalk by hand  
    or blade and separating chaff.

USAGE  
    Used as: coarse meal for flatbread, ration filler, or travel paste base  
    Limitations: low in fat and protein; must be ground or cooked before digestion  
    Preparation: strip seed heads, winnow to remove husks, dry if needed, then crush or grind
