NAME  
    bluegrass_seeds - clustered grass seed used for coarse meal and ration filler

DESCRIPTION  
    Bluegrass is a common wild grass forming dense mats in open terrain.  
    During late-season dry periods, its upper stalks develop compact seed heads  
    that can be stripped and processed into a coarse, low-oil meal. Though not  
    calorie-rich, the seeds offer bulk and can extend limited rations.  
    Most effective when ground and cooked into paste or dry cakes.

    Growth occurs in patches across open meadows and light wood margins.  
    Blades are narrow and deep green. Seed heads emerge upright, branching  
    in narrow fans. Harvesting is done by stripping the upper stalk by hand  
    or blade and separating chaff.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: ground into flatbread or added to broth as filler  
    Thea: mixed into travel paste for sustained low-energy periods  
    Preparation: strip seed heads, dry if needed, winnow to remove husks, crush or grind before use

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: plains, meadow, deciduous_forest

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Poa pratensis
