NAME  
    rose_hip - vitamin-rich fruit from wild rose shrubs

DESCRIPTION  
    Rose hips are the bulbous seed pods that form after the petals of wild roses fall.  
    They are rich in vitamin C and can be foraged in late season, especially after the first frost.  
    The outer skin is firm and waxy; inside is a pulp containing fine hairs and seeds.  
    Eaten raw in small amounts or boiled into syrup or tea. The hairs are irritating  
    and should be removed if possible. Rose hips are a high-value survival forage  
    where fruiting plants are otherwise scarce.

    The shrub has thorny stems, serrated leaves, and pink to pale white flowers.  
    Found along forest edges, hillsides, and stone breaks. Fruit ripens to deep orange  
    or red and remains attached into early frost periods.

USAGE
