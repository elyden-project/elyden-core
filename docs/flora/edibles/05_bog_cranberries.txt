NAME  
    bog_cranberries - tart red fruit growing on creeping wetland vine

DESCRIPTION  
    Bog cranberries are low-growing vines found in cold, acidic wetlands.  
    The plants produce small red berries that ripen late in the season.  
    Fruits are high in moisture, mildly astringent, and provide essential  
    vitamins in foraging scenarios. While sharp in taste, they are safe  
    to eat raw and can be mashed, dried, or preserved. The vines often form  
    mats across peat beds or shallow lake margins.

    Leaves are small and evergreen. Flowers appear pink in spring.  
    Berries grow close to the ground and are best harvested before snowfall.  
    The fruitâ€™s acidic nature makes it resistant to quick spoilage.

USAGE
