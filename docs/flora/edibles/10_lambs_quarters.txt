NAME  
    lambs_quarters - fast-growing leafy green with high mineral content

DESCRIPTION  
    Lambs quarters is a hardy annual plant found in disturbed soil, open clearings,  
    and forest margins. Its soft, pale-green leaves are coated in a fine white film  
    and are rich in calcium, iron, and vitamins A and C. The leaves and young shoots  
    are edible raw or cooked. Older leaves develop oxalates and are better boiled  
    before consumption. Highly nutritious and easily overlooked among common brush.

    The plant has a branching habit, with triangular leaves and a dusty appearance  
    near the growing tip. Seeds form in dense clusters late in the season and are  
    also edible when ground. It thrives in moist ground and grows quickly after  
    ground disturbance or flood retreat.
