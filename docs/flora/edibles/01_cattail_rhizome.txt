NAME  
    cattail_rhizome - starchy wetland root with high survival value

DESCRIPTION  
    Cattail rhizomes grow horizontally beneath shallow water in marshes and lake margins.  
    They are thick, fibrous roots rich in starch and edible tissue. When harvested, the  
    rhizomes can be peeled and boiled to produce a dense, nutritious pulp. Drying and  
    grinding yield a coarse meal useful in survival rations. Spoilage is rapid if left  
    wet after harvesting. Best gathered in cool, low-flow water.

    The plantâ€™s above-ground features include tall, spear-like leaves and a dark brown  
    cylindrical flower spike. Rhizomes grow from the base of mature stalks and often  
    run in networks along the mud layer.

USAGE  
    Used as: boiled food ration, survival starch, field-dried flour base  
    Limitations: spoils quickly if left wet; difficult to extract in frozen soil  
    Preparation: pull root from base, strip outer skin, boil or dry immediately after harvest

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: flood_hollow, swamp, lake

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Typha latifolia
