NAME  
    nettles - iron-rich leafy stalk with stinging hairs

DESCRIPTION  
    Nettles are fast-growing herbaceous plants found along semi-shaded forest margins  
    and moist slopes. They are identified by their serrated leaves and fine stinging  
    hairs which deliver a mild irritant on contact. Once boiled or dried, the stingers  
    are neutralized and the leaves become a nutrient-rich food source high in iron,  
    vitamins, and protein.

    Nettles grow in clusters, often near disturbed soil or water runoff paths.  
    Harvesting is safest with gloves or cloth. Leaves are best taken young and tender.  
    Also usable for tea or dried additive in ration mixes.
