NAME  
    nettles - iron-rich leafy stalk with stinging hairs

DESCRIPTION  
    Nettles are fast-growing herbaceous plants found along semi-shaded forest margins  
    and moist slopes. They are identified by their serrated leaves and fine stinging  
    hairs which deliver a mild irritant on contact. Once boiled or dried, the stingers  
    are neutralized and the leaves become a nutrient-rich food source high in iron,  
    vitamins, and protein.

    Nettles grow in clusters, often near disturbed soil or water runoff paths.  
    Harvesting is safest with gloves or cloth. Leaves are best taken young and tender.  
    Also usable for tea or dried additive in ration mixes.

USAGE  
    Used as: boiled greens, tea infusion, dried additive in ration mixes  
    Limitations: stinging hairs cause skin irritation if raw; unsuitable for direct consumption  
    Preparation: submerge leaves in boiling water until softened; dry flat for storage

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: mixed_forest, deciduous_forest, wet_slope

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Urtica dioica
