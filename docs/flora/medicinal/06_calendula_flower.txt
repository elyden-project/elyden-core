    calendula_flower - bright orange blossom used to reduce swelling and aid surface healing

DESCRIPTION  
    Calendula is a low-growing flowering herb recognized for its vivid yellow to orange petals.  
    It grows in disturbed soils and rocky margins with intermittent heat. The flower heads  
    are harvested and dried for use in poultices, salves, and infusions. When applied topically,  
    calendula may reduce inflammation, ease skin irritation, and promote slow tissue repair.  
    It is commonly used to treat bruises, cracked skin, or light abrasions.

    The plant has rounded leaves and branching stems with a faint herbal scent.  
    Flowers are best gathered before full opening and dried in shade.  
    It is not a strong analgesic but provides surface relief and antiseptic support.

USAGE

    Limitations: not effective for internal or deep-tissue injury
