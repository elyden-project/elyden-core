NAME  
    plantain_leaf - broadleaf plant used to reduce inflammation and draw out skin irritants

DESCRIPTION  
    Plantain is a low-growing herb with wide, oval leaves and deep parallel veins.  
    The leaves can be crushed and applied directly to insect stings, shallow cuts,  
    or skin irritation to reduce inflammation and promote minor healing.  
    It is also chewed and applied as a spit poultice for quick relief in the field.  
    Plantain is one of the most accessible and widely tolerated survival plants.

    Found in meadows, disturbed clearings, and along paths.  
    Leaves grow in a rosette at the base and regenerate quickly when harvested.  
    Does not store well unless dried flat. Loses strength if exposed to heat.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: chewed and applied to bites or minor abrasions during travel  
    Thea: dried and packed into skin-layer wraps for slow-release contact treatment  
    Preparation: harvest outer leaves, rinse clean, use fresh or dry flat in shade

ZONE PRESENCE
