NAME  
    plantain_leaf - broad-leafed herb used to draw out irritation and support clotting

DESCRIPTION  
    Plantain is a low-growing herb with broad, ribbed leaves that grow in basal clusters.  
    It thrives in disturbed soils, path margins, and moist ground. The leaves contain compounds  
    that reduce itching, draw out minor stings or embedded grit, and slow external bleeding.  
    Crushed fresh leaves are applied directly to bites, scrapes, or shallow cuts as a field poultice.

    The plant is easy to recognize by its oval leaves and parallel veins.  
    Young leaves are most effective and should be rinsed before application.  
    It is not useful for internal treatment or for puncture wounds.

USAGE  
    Used as: fresh poultice for insect bites, surface cuts, and clotting support  
    Limitations: ineffective once dried; not a disinfectant  
    Preparation: rinse leaf, crush by hand or stone, bind against affected area with wrap

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: meadow, wet_slope
