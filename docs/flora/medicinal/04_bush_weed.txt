NAME  
    bush_weed - multipurpose plant used for pain calming, ration additive, and fiber draw

DESCRIPTION  
    Bush weed is a tall, branching herb with coarse leaves, clustered seed heads,  
    and a fibrous stalk. It grows rapidly in disturbed soils and meadow margins.  
    Dried leaves and flowers may be burned or smoked in low doses for mild pain  
    management, calming effect, or sleep induction. Seeds and leaves are also edible  
    in small quantities and added to ration pastes for bulk and oil. The stalk produces  
    a stringy fiber that can be drawn for rough cord or textile backing.

    The plant has serrated palmate leaves and a strong scent.  
    Leaf and flower potency declines after seeding. Stalks should be retted  
    or soaked before fiber use. High intake of smoke or seed can impair clarity.

USAGE  
    Used as: low-grade smoke inhalant for calming or discomfort relief; ration bulk oil source;  
             fiber draw material for cordage  
    Limitations: overuse affects focus; raw fiber weak unless processed  
    Preparation: dry leaves for burning or paste; crack seed in blend; soak stalk for fiber separation
