NAME  
    bush_weed - resinous herb used for sedation and pain dulling in recovery

DESCRIPTION  
    Bush weed is a coarse, upright-growing plant with sharply lobed, serrated leaves  
    and a strong scent. Its dried leaves and flowering tops can be smoked or steeped  
    to induce mild sedation, reduce pain, and ease muscle tension. Effects include  
    slowed reflexes, lowered anxiety, and improved rest under field recovery conditions.  
    It is not curative but useful for managing exhaustion and injury stress.

    Grows in open soil with full sun exposure, often along disturbed clearings or  
    the edge of mixed forests. Flowering tops exude a sticky resin when mature.  
    Plants reach up to two meters in height and spread laterally when unharvested.  
    Seeds are edible if roasted but not gathered for food in field use.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: smoked during rest periods or infused to assist post-exertion recovery  
    Thea: added to bait preparations to dull enemy coordination or delay pursuit  
    Preparation: dry upper leaves and flower bracts in shade; store sealed from light and moisture
