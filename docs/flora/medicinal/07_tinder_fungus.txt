NAME  
    tinder_fungus - shelf fungus used for wound drying, cauterization prep, and firestarting

DESCRIPTION  
    Tinder fungus refers to the fruiting body of *Fomes fomentarius*,  
    a hard, hoof-shaped shelf fungus found on dead or dying trees.  
    It has a dry, fibrous core that absorbs moisture and blood,  
    making it useful for field dressings where no cloth is available.  
    When processed and dried, it also takes and holds a spark,  
    allowing dual use as both wound pack and ignition starter.

    Grows on hardwood trunks, especially birch or beech, in cool forest zones.  
    The outer rind is grey and hard; the inner flesh is brown and layered.  
    Can be sliced into flat pads when fresh, then dried for storage or use.  
    Must be removed from host tree with a knife or wedge.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: shaved and dried for firestarting or packed against abrasions  
    Thea: crushed and folded into delayed cauterant wraps or trap igniters  
    Preparation: cut from trunk, slice through core, dry fully before carrying
