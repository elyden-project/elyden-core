NAME  
    tinder_fungus - bracket fungus used for drying wounds and reducing surface infection

DESCRIPTION  
    Tinder fungus is a hard, hoof-shaped polypore that grows on birch and other hardwoods.  
    Though often associated with fire-starting, its inner flesh has traditional use in drying  
    shallow wounds and reducing microbial load. The sterile layer can be shaved into strips  
    or flakes and applied as a semi-dry barrier or compress insert. It inhibits surface  
    contamination while allowing airflow to damaged tissue.

    The fruiting body is brown and woody on the outside, with a soft tan interior.  
    Collection is safest from standing or freshly fallen trunks. Older specimens may be  
    insect-infested or too rigid to use.

USAGE  
    Used as: wound-drying pad, field dressing insert, or antiseptic layer in bandage stack  
    Limitations: ineffective when wet; outer crust must be removed before use  
    Preparation: slice inner layer into flat strips, press lightly onto clean surface, bind securely

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: deciduous_forest

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Fomes fomentarius
