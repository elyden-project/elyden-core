NAME  
    yarrow - flowering plant used for clotting and surface wound treatment

DESCRIPTION  
    Yarrow is a perennial herb known for its feathery leaves and dense white or pink flower heads.  
    It grows in dry grasslands, meadows, and disturbed open soil. The leaves contain compounds  
    that promote clotting and have mild antiseptic properties. Crushed fresh, they can be applied  
    directly to cuts and abrasions to slow bleeding and reduce surface infection risk.

    The plant stands 30â€“60 cm tall with flat-topped inflorescences. Leaves are finely divided  
    and aromatic when crushed. Flowering occurs in late season. It is often overlooked due to  
    its soft appearance but is valued in field dressing kits.
