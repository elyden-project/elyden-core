NAME  
    yarrow - aromatic leaf and flower used for clotting, swelling, and wound packing

DESCRIPTION  
    Yarrow is a hardy herb with feathery leaves and small white flower clusters.  
    It grows in open meadows and disturbed plains. The plant contains compounds  
    that encourage blood clotting and reduce surface inflammation. Crushed leaves  
    are used to pack shallow wounds, while flower infusions may ease skin irritation  
    and reduce localized swelling.

    The entire plant has a sharp, slightly bitter scent.  
    Leaves should be taken before flowering for best potency.  
    Flowers are collected dry for steeping or blending into compresses.

USAGE  
    Used as: wound pack, bruise dressing, floral infusion for minor swelling  
    Limitations: loses effectiveness when wet-packed too long; not for deep punctures  
    Preparation: crush fresh leaves for clotting, dry flowers for infusions or field poultice mix

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: meadow, plains

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Achillea millefolium
