    willow_bark - salicylate-rich bark used in poultice treatment for pain and inflammation

DESCRIPTION  
    Willow is a deciduous tree or shrub with long, narrow leaves and flexible branches.  
    The inner bark contains salicin, a natural compound that reduces pain and swelling  
    when applied topically or infused. Stripped bark can be used in field treatments  
    for muscle strain, bruising, and joint stress. Not suitable for internal use without refinement.

    Grows along rivers, lake margins, and lowland plains where water is consistent.  
    Bark is harvested from young branches or twigs, avoiding damage to the trunk.  
    Best gathered in spring or early thaw when sap begins to rise.  
    Tannin content requires bark to be cured or boiled before application.
