NAME  
    willow_bark - pain-reducing bark used for inflammation and field analgesia

DESCRIPTION  
    Willow bark is harvested from young branches and stems of the white willow.  
    The inner bark contains salicin, a compound that reduces pain and inflammation  
    when chewed or brewed. It is commonly used to manage fever, joint pain,  
    or headache symptoms in low-resource settings.

    Bark should be gathered from flexible limbs during cool, dry conditions.  
    Outer bark is stripped away to access the moist inner layer, which can  
    be shaved, dried, or steeped. Effects are slow-acting and best suited for  
    persistent discomfort rather than acute trauma.

USAGE  
    Used as: brewed infusion or chew for pain relief and anti-inflammatory effect  
    Limitations: not suitable for internal bleeding or allergic individuals; high doses cause nausea  
    Preparation: strip inner bark from young branch, dry or steep in warm water before use

ZONE PRESENCE
