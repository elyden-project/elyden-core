NAME  
    bandage_lichen - fibrous pale lichen used for wrapping wounds and absorbing fluid

DESCRIPTION  
    Bandage lichen is a soft, elastic growth found on bark and stone in high-altitude,  
    clean-air environments. It forms light, tangled mats that are strong when dry and  
    pliable when damp. Its structure wicks moisture from shallow cuts and protects  
    against surface exposure. It is not adhesive but holds shape well when layered  
    with bark or cord.

    Often seen in wind-scoured terrain, it appears pale green or grey with branching  
    threads. Best harvested dry, then rinsed before use. When clean, it can be packed  
    directly over wounds or folded into layered wraps. Not edible and loses structure  
    if burned or overheated.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: wrapped around minor wounds or joints to reduce abrasion  
    Thea: packed under compresses or used as poultice filler in cold zones  
    Preparation: gather gently by hand, rinse in clean water, apply dry or damp

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: tundra, unclimbable_ridge

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Usnea barbata
