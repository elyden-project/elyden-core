NAME  
    bandage_lichen - antiseptic lichen used for dressing wounds and preventing surface infection

DESCRIPTION  
    Bandage lichen is a pale green-grey fruticose lichen that grows in dry, cold zones  
    along high ridgelines and exposed tundra surfaces. It contains usnic acid, a compound  
    with antimicrobial properties, making it useful as a sterile field dressing.  
    When applied directly, it suppresses bacterial growth and protects shallow abrasions  
    or cuts from further exposure.

    The lichen hangs in strands from rock or wood and has a coarse, fibrous texture.  
    It is best used dry and layered between cloth or bark to hold it in place.  
    Growth is slow and should be harvested sparingly to avoid overcollection.

USAGE  
    Used as: antimicrobial wound dressing, sterile layer in compress wraps  
    Limitations: not suitable for deep wounds or where moisture will saturate it  
    Preparation: collect dry from wood or stone, press flat into clean layer before applying

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: tundra, unclimbable_ridge

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Usnea barbata
