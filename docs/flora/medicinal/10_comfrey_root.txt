NAME  
    comfrey_root - thick healing root used to promote tissue recovery and bone stabilization

DESCRIPTION  
    Comfrey is a perennial herb with large, bristled leaves and thick tapering roots.  
    The root contains allantoin, a compound known to support cell regeneration and  
    reduce inflammation. When grated or pulped, it forms a dense paste that can be  
    packed against bruises, sprains, or fractured areas to promote healing.  
    Not for internal use. Overuse may cause liver stress due to pyrrolizidine alkaloids.

    Comfrey grows in moist, nutrient-rich soil near seasonal flood zones or meadow margins.  
    Its leaves are large and hairy with a pronounced midrib. Flowers are tubular and  
    range from purple to white. Roots are black on the outside and creamy within.  
    Should be harvested from second-year plants for highest compound concentration.
