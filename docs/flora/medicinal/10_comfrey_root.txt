NAME  
    comfrey_root - fibrous root used for bone-set poultice and swelling reduction

DESCRIPTION  
    Comfrey is a perennial herb with large hairy leaves and thick tapering roots.  
    The root contains allantoin, a compound believed to promote cell repair and reduce  
    swelling. It is traditionally mashed into a wet poultice and applied to sprains,  
    bruises, or bone-setting wraps to stabilize and support external recovery.

    The plant grows in moist, open ground and produces bell-shaped purple flowers.  
    Roots are dark on the outside and pale inside, harvested in late season for maximum potency.  
    Not consumed due to risk of liver damage when taken internally.
