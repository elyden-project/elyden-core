NAME  
    cladophora_algae - filamentous freshwater algae used for cooling and surface moisture buffering

DESCRIPTION  
    Cladophora is a bright green, hair-like algae found in cool, slow-moving freshwater zones.  
    It forms dense mats on submerged rocks, shallow lakebeds, or shaded shorelines.  
    When cleaned and applied fresh, it serves as a temporary cooling layer on bruises,  
    mild burns, or heat-swollen injuries. Though not antiseptic, it transfers heat away  
    from tissue and retains surface moisture.

    The algae is slippery and fibrous, with strands that clump into pads when handled.  
    Harvest is easiest by hand at waterline margins or from stable submerged stone.  
    Must be cleaned thoroughly to remove silt and insect larvae.

USAGE  
    Used as: field-cooled compress, surface swelling reducer, moisture-retentive wrap base  
    Limitations: non-sterile unless boiled; not suitable for open wounds  
    Preparation: rinse in clean water, apply directly to skin, bind with cloth if needed

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: lake, flood_hollow, swamp

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Cladophora glomerata
