NAME  
    cladophora_algae - filamentous green algae used for poultice hydration and cooling wraps

DESCRIPTION  
    Cladophora algae forms dense green mats in shallow, slow-moving freshwater.  
    It has a soft, thread-like structure and holds moisture without breaking down quickly.  
    In survival use, it is packed into cloth or bark to cool inflamed skin, reduce surface heat,  
    and keep poultices hydrated. It has no antiseptic property, but helps retain applied salves.

    Found along lake edges, stagnant channels, and wetland pools. It floats in loose sheets  
    or clings to submerged rock and vegetation. Easily harvested by hand.  
    Must be rinsed thoroughly to remove insects or sediment. Spoils rapidly if left warm or enclosed.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: applied to overheated skin or swelling after extended exertion  
    Thea: wrapped around poultice core to regulate temperature and slow drying  
    Preparation: collect by hand, rinse with clean water, apply wet or chilled

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: lake, flood_hollow, swamp

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Cladophora glomerata
