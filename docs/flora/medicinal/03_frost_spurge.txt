NAME  
    frost_spurge - cold-tolerant herb used as blister agent and surface cauterant

DESCRIPTION  
    Frost spurge is a small herbaceous plant with narrow leaves and milky sap.  
    It grows close to the ground in exposed frost sink basins and tundra margins.  
    The white latex exuded from broken stems acts as a mild irritant, historically used  
    to cauterize shallow wounds, dry infections, or induce surface blistering.  
    It is not consumed and must be applied with care.

    The plant has a wiry branching structure and forms loose mats across gravel or permafrost.  
    Sap is active even in cold conditions. Gloves or barrier tools are required  
    during collection and application. Overuse causes skin burns or rash.

USAGE  
    Used as: external cauterant, blister stimulant, topical irritant for drying lesions  
    Limitations: causes skin damage with prolonged contact; never apply to open tissue  
    Preparation: break stem at base, allow sap to bead, apply carefully with stick or cloth tip

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: frost_sink, tundra
