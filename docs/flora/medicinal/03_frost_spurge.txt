NAME  
    frost_spurge - cold-zone plant with caustic sap used to sterilize wounds

DESCRIPTION  
    Frost spurge is a low, sprawling plant with narrow needle-like leaves and pale stems.  
    It thrives in nutrient-poor, wind-exposed permafrost terrain. When cut, the plant  
    releases a milky white sap that is chemically irritating. Applied carefully, this sap  
    can be used to sterilize small wounds or kill surface parasites. Overuse causes skin damage.  
    Gloves or cloth are recommended when harvesting.

    Spurge forms dense mats close to the ground. Its stem tips often redden in late season.  
    Animals avoid it, and it rarely grows near forageable flora. Active compounds remain  
    stable in dry or frozen form.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: sap applied to thorn wounds or to sterilize knife edges  
    Thea: used sparingly in blade coating or on trap barbs to prevent rot  
    Preparation: snip stem tip, express sap directly; store in bark wrap or absorbent cloth

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: frost_sink, tundra

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Euphorbia cyparissias
