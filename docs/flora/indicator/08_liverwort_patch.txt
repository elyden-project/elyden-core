NAME  
    liverwort_patch - low, thalloid growth indicating geothermal seepage or mineral disturbance

DESCRIPTION  
    Liverworts are simple, flat plants forming dense green mats across moist soil,  
    rock surfaces, or volcanic sediment. Their leafless, lobed thalli cling to surfaces  
    in high humidity, low light, and thermally active zones. Unlike moss, they lack upright structure  
    and spread laterally across bare ground or stone.

    Liverwort patches often appear where geothermal warmth thins frost layers  
    or where acidic leach disrupts plant succession. Their presence marks  
    chemical imbalance or chronic moisture exposure, especially in unstable slopes  
    or post-burn zones. Growth favors low competition and direct contact with mineral crust.

USAGE  
    Indicator of: shallow geothermal activity, mineral seepage, disrupted plant succession  
    Limitations: desiccates quickly in sun; requires high ambient moisture  
    Observation: presence confirms terrain instability or post-thermal soil turnover

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: swamp, volcanic_slope

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Marchantia polymorpha
