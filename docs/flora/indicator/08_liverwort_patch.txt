NAME  
    liverwort_patch - low spongy ground cover indicating chemical imbalance and geothermal moisture

DESCRIPTION  
    Liverworts are flat, leafless plants that form mats in highly humid, low-light environments.  
    Their presence often marks acidic, mineral-rich ground or geothermal seepage zones.  
    Growth suggests consistent surface saturation and chemical disturbance, especially in areas  
    of volcanic activity or rotted substrate.

    Found in swamp margins, near hot ground vents, or in decaying root beds.  
    Liverworts appear as green, irregular lobed carpets with no upright stem.  
    Sensitive to heat shifts and exposure. Will retreat rapidly from disturbed terrain  
    or dry air intrusion.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: identifies unsuitable ground for resting or storage due to acidity or rot  
    Thea: used to confirm moisture escape paths or potential gas seep locations  
    Preparation: not collected - observed as terrain warning at microhabitat scale

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: swamp, volcanic_slope

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Marchantia polymorpha
