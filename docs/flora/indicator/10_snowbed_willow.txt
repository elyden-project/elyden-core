NAME  
    snowbed_willow - ground-hugging alpine shrub indicating late-melting snow and permafrost buffering

DESCRIPTION  
    Snowbed willow is a dwarf-form willow that grows flat across tundra and glacial margins.  
    It is adapted to extremely short growing seasons, appearing only in areas where snow  
    persists late into thaw cycles. Its creeping structure and compact leaves  
    help it retain warmth and moisture in permafrost-affected zones.

    This species colonizes melt basins, shallow depressions, and cold wind-protected slopes.  
    Its presence confirms annual snow accumulation and late ground thaw,  
    typically in locations where deeper-rooted plants cannot survive.  
    Often accompanied by mosses or freeze-adapted ferns.

USAGE  
    Indicator of: snowbed persistence, cryotic ground, seasonal melt flow from glacial overspill  
    Limitations: absent in windswept ridges or well-drained alpine rock zones  
    Observation: marks late-thaw basins and cold trap depressions for permafrost modeling

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: tundra, ice_shelf

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Salix herbacea
