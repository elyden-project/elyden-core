NAME  
    snowbed_willow - prostrate alpine shrub marking cold-locked terrain and persistent snow cover

DESCRIPTION  
    Snowbed willow is a creeping woody plant that hugs the ground in wind-scoured alpine zones.  
    Its growth signals extended snow cover, minimal soil depth, and extreme cold retention.  
    Presence suggests long seasonal frost and weak melt cycles, often near glacial margins or  
    permanent ice shelf edges.

    Found in tundra flats, ice shelf margins, and other high-exposure coldplate zones.  
    Plants rarely exceed a few centimeters in height. Leaves are rounded and waxy,  
    appearing briefly during thaw windows. Root systems are shallow, spreading laterally.  
    Growth density reflects duration of seasonal exposure.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: used to mark glacial edges and determine traversal risk or thermal loss zones  
    Thea: avoids for trap placement - indicates poor coverage, low pressure, and extreme exposure  
    Preparation: not harvested - read from low coverage and survival density in frostbound terrain

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: tundra, ice_shelf

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Salix herbacea
