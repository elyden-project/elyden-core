NAME  
    polypody_fern - leathery-leaved fern indicating stable moisture and shallow mineral substrate

DESCRIPTION  
    Polypody fern grows in clumps along rock faces, fallen logs, and moist soil banks.  
    It thrives in areas with constant, non-saturated moisture and partial light.  
    Its leathery fronds are evergreen in milder cycles, curling during cold or dry periods.  
    The plant is sensitive to mechanical disturbance but resilient under stable moisture exposure.

    Its presence reflects shallow soil, high mineral content, and consistent humidity.  
    It anchors itself in mossy or organic debris over stone, preferring places  
    where runoff occurs but does not collect. Useful in identifying low-flow slope transitions.

USAGE  
    Indicator of: persistent humidity, surface mineral exposure, thin soil over rock  
    Limitations: absent from flooded, compacted, or sun-exposed terrain  
    Observation: found along slope margins, stone breaks, and moss-lined runoff paths

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: wet_slope, mixed_forest

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Polypodium vulgare
