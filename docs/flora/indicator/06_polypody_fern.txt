NAME  
    polypody_fern - shallow-rooting epiphyte used to identify damp, shaded slopes and canopy drip zones

DESCRIPTION  
    Polypody fern grows in small clusters along rocky outcrops, mossy trunks, or decaying logs.  
    It prefers areas with steady humidity and filtered light, often near slopes that collect  
    rainfall or along volcanic ridgelines. Presence indicates consistent condensation,  
    low wind exposure, and a stable mid-canopy environment.

    Found in mixed forest understory, on wet slopes, or at the base of moss-coated trees.  
    Fronds are narrow, deeply lobed, and evergreen. Roots form shallow mats and do not penetrate  
    deeply into soil, making the plant sensitive to drying or surface disruption.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: used to locate long-drip canopy zones for shelter or fresh condensation collection  
    Thea: marks terrain that holds humidity - good for scent-based tracking or moisture traps  
    Preparation: not collected - read from placement and frond density on rock or trunk

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: wet_slope, mixed_forest

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Polypodium vulgare
