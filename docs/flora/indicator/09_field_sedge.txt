NAME  
    field_sedge - narrow-bladed grasslike plant indicating compacted soil and seasonal surface runoff

DESCRIPTION  
    Field sedge forms dense clumps in open terrain where water gathers and drains cyclically.  
    Its narrow, upright leaves resemble coarse grass but grow in tighter clusters,  
    often marking trails, depressions, or low-gradient runoff lines. The plant tolerates  
    trampling and poor soil aeration, making it one of the first species to recolonize  
    after disturbance or seasonal pooling.

    Presence indicates moderate moisture availability, compacted or clay-rich soil,  
    and past hydrological activity. It grows along flood retreat paths, shallow drainage  
    channels, or meadow basins that dry between wet seasons.

USAGE  
    Indicator of: compacted ground, former pooling zones, intermittent water flow  
    Limitations: disappears in well-drained or shaded canopy terrain  
    Observation: track alignment tool for runoff modeling and soil saturation memory

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: plains, meadow

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Carex praegracilis
