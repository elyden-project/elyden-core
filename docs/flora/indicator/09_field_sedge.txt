NAME  
    field_sedge - wiry grasslike plant marking compacted ground and seasonal dryness

DESCRIPTION  
    Field sedge is a short, tufted plant with narrow, stiff blades and triangular stems.  
    It grows in open terrain with compacted soil and tolerates mild drought, indicating  
    hardened surfaces and intermittent water stress. Its presence suggests shallow root  
    penetration, trampling, or long-term grazing pressure.

    Found in meadows, grasslands, and plains with light runoff and shallow water retention.  
    Growth forms dense clumps that resist disturbance. Lacks flowering display;  
    spreads primarily by underground rhizome. Color fades to grey or yellow in dry periods.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: used to evaluate pack routes and determine ground pressure from animal traffic  
    Thea: observed for predicting prey movement across bottlenecks or hardened path margins  
    Preparation: not harvested - observed in clump density and growth angles

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: plains, meadow

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Carex praegracilis
