NAME  
    flora_indicator_index - non-harvestable flora used to assess terrain and environmental stability

DESCRIPTION  
    This index lists real-world plants whose presence indicates local terrain,  
    water content, mineral bias, or long-term biome conditions. These species  
    are not harvested but noted for their diagnostic value in field observation.

    Their growth patterns may signal permafrost zones, glacial movement,  
    wetland saturation, soil acidity, or geothermal activity.  
    Recognizing these markers improves route planning and long-term survival.
