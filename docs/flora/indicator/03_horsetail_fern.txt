NAME  
    horsetail_fern - segmented wetland fern indicating silty floodplain and shallow subsurface water

DESCRIPTION  
    Horsetail is a primitive vascular plant with jointed, hollow stems  
    and radial stem whorls. It thrives in saturated soils along lake margins,  
    drainage paths, and periodically flooded hollows. Its presence indicates  
    high silt content, shallow seasonal saturation, and mineral runoff deposition.

    Horsetail colonies expand by underground rhizomes and can spread rapidly  
    after disturbance or water fluctuation. Above-ground stalks are stiff,  
    ridged, and dark green with a bristled surface texture. Growth is highly  
    sensitive to drainage and soil composition, making it useful for  
    reading terrain transitions in waterlogged zones.

USAGE  
    Indicator of: silty or mineral-rich wetland soil, high seasonal moisture, low gradient runoff  
    Limitations: presence may fade in prolonged dry cycles or near dense canopy  
    Observation: growth signals sediment-rich flood history and shallow groundwater access

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: lake, flood_hollow

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Equisetum arvense
