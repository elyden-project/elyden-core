NAME  
    horsetail_fern - segmented wetland plant marking ancient water paths and mineral-rich ground

DESCRIPTION  
    Horsetail is a jointed, hollow-stemmed plant with whorled branches that grow in clusters.  
    It thrives in saturated soil with high silica content and often follows historical runoff paths.  
    Its presence indicates persistent moisture, shallow groundwater, or subsurface mineral leaching.  
    Not found in dry or high-slope terrain.

    Grows along lake margins, seasonal flood zones, and low ridges with poor drainage.  
    Height varies from knee-high to waist-height depending on age and exposure.  
    Stems snap easily when dry and leave ringed segments behind. Reproduces by underground rhizomes.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: used to detect historical flood edges or safe crossing routes  
    Thea: marks potential sediment traps or animal watering trails  
    Preparation: not collected - used visually to trace wetland margins and seasonal runoff

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: lake, flood_hollow

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Equisetum arvense
