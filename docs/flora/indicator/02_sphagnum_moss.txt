NAME  
    sphagnum_moss - moisture-retaining moss used to identify saturation and unstable ground

DESCRIPTION  
    Sphagnum is a spongy, absorbent moss that grows in thick mats over wet ground,  
    especially where drainage is poor. Its structure retains water many times its own weight,  
    forming peat over time. Its presence signals high water retention, hidden subsurface flow,  
    or bog-like terrain that may shift under load.

    Grows in low depressions, stagnant wetlands, and on floating mats near lake edges.  
    Color ranges from pale green to reddish brown depending on moisture and sun exposure.  
    Often covers root hummocks, obscuring depth and ground consistency.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: identifies unstable footing and hidden water channels; avoided for shelter placement  
    Thea: used to track displaced terrain where prey or people may have recently crossed  
    Preparation: not harvested - observed in patches to assess ground saturation and root cover

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: flood_hollow, swamp

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Sphagnum palustre
