NAME  
    sphagnum_moss - moisture-retaining moss indicating peat formation and standing saturation

DESCRIPTION  
    Sphagnum moss forms dense, spongy mats in lowland wetlands, shallow basins,  
    and poorly drained flood zones. It has a bright green to reddish tone depending  
    on acidity and saturation level. Each plant absorbs many times its weight in  
    water, creating stable, slow-draining environments ideal for bog succession.

    Its presence signifies long-term water retention, poor drainage, and acidic soil.  
    Areas dominated by sphagnum are difficult to traverse and prone to deep-rooted  
    instability. Below the moss layer, anaerobic conditions and organic buildup  
    may produce methane or concealed pockets of unstable peat.

USAGE  
    Indicator of: persistent wetland saturation, high water table, acidic anaerobic soil  
    Limitations: surface may appear solid but often hides soft substrate  
    Observation: avoid crossing large mats; growth suggests impassable or dangerous ground

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: flood_hollow, swamp

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Sphagnum palustre
