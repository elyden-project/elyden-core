NAME  
    haircap_moss - upright moss species indicating cold retention and moderate water access

DESCRIPTION  
    Haircap moss forms dense vertical colonies of stiff, green shoots with pointed tips.  
    It favors damp soil and shaded forest margins where temperature remains low and  
    moisture is steady but not saturated. Its structure resists frost and insulates  
    shallow root networks, making it a reliable marker of cold persistence and canopy cover.

    Found beneath deciduous or coniferous trees in highland zones and frost basins.  
    Colonies grow thickly over stone, soil, or rotting wood.  
    Often the first sign of ground thaw near permafrost boundaries.  
    Avoids heavily trampled or compacted terrain.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: used to track cold-edge habitat or predict thaw basin melt timing  
    Thea: observed for cover dynamics around traps; its disturbance may reveal passage  
    Preparation: not harvested - examined for density and moisture content across slope or ridge

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: deciduous_forest, frost_sink

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Polytrichum commune
