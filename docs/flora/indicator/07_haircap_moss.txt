NAME  
    haircap_moss - upright moss indicating cold moisture, acidic soil, and freeze retention

DESCRIPTION  
    Haircap moss forms dense, upright colonies with stiff green stalks and  
    star-shaped tips. It prefers undisturbed soil with persistent cold moisture,  
    often appearing near melt runoffs, frost pockets, or shaded forest depressions.  
    The plant retains water effectively and remains upright even during frost exposure,  
    making it a useful marker of ground-level thermal buffering.

    Growth indicates low pH, shaded persistence, and low wind exposure.  
    It thrives in regions where surface water seeps or evaporates slowly.  
    Easily distinguished by its vertical form and fine cap structures at stem tips.

USAGE  
    Indicator of: frost sink behavior, cold moisture retention, acidic substrate  
    Limitations: vulnerable to foot disturbance; dies back in dry upland terrain  
    Observation: signals long freeze duration and unreliable ground thaw

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: deciduous_forest, frost_sink

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Polytrichum commune
