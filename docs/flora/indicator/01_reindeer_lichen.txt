NAME  
    reindeer_lichen - pale ground lichen indicating persistent cold and mineral-poor substrate

DESCRIPTION  
    Reindeer lichen is a dense, bushy lichen with a pale, whitish-green color  
    and a coral-like branching structure. It grows directly on the soil or thin moss  
    crust in open tundra and frost sink zones. Its slow growth rate and sensitivity  
    to disturbance make it a reliable indicator of long-term cold exposure, dry wind,  
    and low-nutrient soil.

    The presence of reindeer lichen often marks terrain that is stable but barren,  
    with poor topsoil and minimal plant competition. Its distribution may be  
    interrupted by ice crusts, exposed rock, or repeated freeze-thaw scouring.

USAGE  
    Indicator of: prolonged permafrost exposure, low soil fertility, limited melt infiltration  
    Limitations: does not grow in compacted areas or where foot traffic is frequent  
    Observation: avoid as travel route; growth signals cold persistence and poor yield zones

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: tundra, frost_sink

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Cladonia rangiferina
