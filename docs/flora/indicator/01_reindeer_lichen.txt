NAME  
    reindeer_lichen - frost-tolerant lichen indicating cold, low-nutrient permafrost terrain

DESCRIPTION  
    Reindeer lichen forms dense, branching mats over bare soil, rock, or thin frost.  
    Its pale grey-green color and coral-like texture make it visible across flat open ground.  
    Indicates poor nutrient levels, permanent frost presence, and long-term ground stability.  
    Will not grow in disturbed or melt-prone zones.

    Found in windswept tundra and permafrost basins.  
    Grows slowly and recovers poorly after trampling.  
    Presence in dense mats suggests stable cold biome conditions  
    with minimal surface runoff and low decay activity.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: used to confirm permanent cold zone boundaries or plan high-ground travel  
    Thea: noted as footprint-sensitive terrain; signs of disruption indicate movement or passage  
    Preparation: not collected or processed - read from surface coverage and density

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: tundra, frost_sink

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Cladonia rangiferina
