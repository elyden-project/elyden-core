NAME  
    clubmoss - creeping ground cover indicating cold shade, acidic soil, and periglacial surface

DESCRIPTION  
    Clubmoss is a low-growing vascular plant resembling miniature conifers.  
    It forms dense mats across shaded forest floors and glacial fringes,  
    often where soil is thin, cold, and acidic. Growth is slow, spreading by rhizomes  
    in undisturbed environments with stable shade and low competition.

    Its presence signals poor decomposition rates, reduced sunlight, and surface  
    conditions shaped by glacial runoff or freeze-thaw erosion. Clubmoss often grows  
    alongside fungi or lichens but avoids water-saturated ground. Shoots are stiff,  
    upright, and covered in scale-like leaves that remain evergreen.

USAGE  
    Indicator of: glacially influenced soil, low nutrient turnover, long-term canopy shade  
    Limitations: disappears under canopy disturbance or thermal fluctuation  
    Observation: confirms low-yield terrain with cold buffering and limited soil formation

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: evergreen_forest, glacier

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Lycopodium clavatum
