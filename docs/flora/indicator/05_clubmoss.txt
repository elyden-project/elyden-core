NAME  
    clubmoss - low creeping plant used to identify undisturbed ground and deep-root forest stability

DESCRIPTION  
    Clubmoss is a primitive vascular plant with dense, scale-like leaves and creeping stems.  
    It thrives in undisturbed, stable soils and slow-changing microclimates.  
    Its presence suggests minimal erosion, consistent shade, and intact root systems.  
    Easily disrupted by trampling or soil shift.

    Found beneath evergreen canopy or along glacier-fed forest margins.  
    Forms low mats or upright tufts resembling miniature conifers.  
    Reproduction is slow; recovery after disturbance takes multiple seasons.  
    Once common, now sparse in exposed or high-trafficked regions.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: used to confirm ground stability or select untouched paths  
    Thea: indicates zones where traps may persist undetected due to low wildlife passage  
    Preparation: not harvested - read from intact ground cover and growth density

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: evergreen_forest, glacier

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Lycopodium clavatum
