NAME  
    wolf_lichen - bright toxic lichen marking exposed, nutrient-poor slopes and mineral imbalance

DESCRIPTION  
    Wolf lichen is a vivid yellow-green fruticose lichen that grows on sun-exposed bark,  
    rock, and decaying wood. Its presence indicates low-nutrient substrates and high UV exposure.  
    Often found where trees are stunted or dying, or where soil chemistry prevents dense undergrowth.  
    Contains vulpinic acid - mildly toxic to fauna, avoided by most grazers.

    Grows in dry, open highland areas or cold forest fringes with minimal canopy.  
    Lichen forms tufts or drapes over rough bark and stone.  
    Its brightness contrasts with surrounding decay, making it useful for identifying stressed zones.  
    Not edible or usable as fuel.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: noted when evaluating timberline decline or hillside stability  
    Thea: observed for root exposure and terrain stress around shelter or trap sites  
    Preparation: not collected - visible in color patches on stumps, rock, or shallow soil

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: hills, evergreen_forest

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Letharia vulpina
