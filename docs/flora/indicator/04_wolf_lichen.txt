NAME  
    wolf_lichen - bright green lichen indicating clean air, open exposure, and dry bark substrate

DESCRIPTION  
    Wolf lichen is a bushy, fluorescent yellow-green lichen that grows on bark,  
    deadwood, and exposed rock in well-ventilated, dry climates. Its presence reflects  
    high air quality, strong solar exposure, and unshaded conditions, typically  
    along ridgelines, sparse evergreen stands, or wind-exposed slopes.

    The lichen prefers dry, acidic substrates and does not tolerate pollution or  
    deep canopy. Its coloration makes it visible from distance, and it often appears  
    first on weathered trees in transition zones. Abundant growth may signal poor soil  
    retention and surface desiccation.

USAGE  
    Indicator of: high solar exposure, dry slope climate, and low atmospheric pollution  
    Limitations: absent under heavy canopy or in saturated zones  
    Observation: useful for tracing ridgeline dryness and open terrain stability

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: hills, evergreen_forest

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Letharia vulpina
