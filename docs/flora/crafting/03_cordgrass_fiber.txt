NAME  
    cordgrass_fiber - long-bladed grass stripped into cordage and binder wrap

DESCRIPTION  
    Cordgrass is a tall, salt-tolerant grass with narrow, fibrous blades.  
    The leaves contain long cellulose strands that can be split and twisted  
    into light cord, wrap ties, or bundle lashings. Fibers are coarse when dry  
    but flexible if soaked. Used for temporary bindings, braidline, or net backing.

    Grows in dense stands along wet margins and brackish inlets.  
    Blades reach waist height, taper to a sharp edge, and remain upright in shallow water.  
    Harvested by cutting at the base and stripping outer sheath. Best used green or soaked  
    before twist. Not suitable for fine textiles or heavy tension.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: stripped for field lashings and binding forage packs  
    Thea: twisted into net loops or trip tension lines in wet terrain  
    Preparation: cut at stalk base, split with thumb or blade, soak or twist to bind

ZONE PRESENCE
