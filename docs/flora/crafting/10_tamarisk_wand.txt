NAME  
    tamarisk_wand - flexible woody stem used for trap arms and lightweight framing

DESCRIPTION  
    Tamarisk is a shrubby plant found in saline flats and drainage-prone lowlands.  
    It produces long, slender stems that remain springy even when dried, making them  
    ideal for tension arms, light trap triggers, or temporary frame extensions.  
    Bark is thin and peels easily. Wood is not strong but holds shape under light  
    force and rebounds cleanly when bent. Growth is dense and often forms thickets  
    near flood retreats or exposed sediment layers.

    Harvested stems are best taken before full lignification sets in.  
    Older stalks become brittle and prone to snapping.  
    The wood burns poorly and is not used for fuel.  
    Surface grain is smooth; can be shaved or notched without splitting.

USAGE  
    Used as: trap arms, flexible framing, shaft core material, tension lash insert  
    Limitations: brittle if harvested too late; not suitable for weight-bearing load  
    Preparation: cut near base, strip bark, dry straight or bind into curve under tension

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: flood_hollow, badlands

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Tamarix ramosissima
