NAME  
    pine_tree - resinous highland conifer used for pitch and fire support

DESCRIPTION  
    Pine is a tall, cold-adapted conifer found in evergreen forests and upper slopes.  
    It produces thick, scaly bark and exudes amber resin at damaged sites. Resin is soft  
    when warm and brittle when cold. Bark can be rendered to extract dense, tar-like pitch  
    suitable for sealing and ignition. Both materials are valuable in survival tasks  
    requiring adhesion, waterproofing, or fire acceleration.

    Resin is scraped from natural seep or shallow cuts and stored cool. Pitch is produced  
    by boiling bark flakes or scorching over fire, then cooled and packed in bark wrap.  
    Collection is safest in dry weather from downed trees or mature specimens.  
    Pine wood is unsuitable for load-bearing use due to warping and splinter risk.  
    Resin and pitch are not interchangeable but derived from the same source.

USAGE  
    Used as: resin sealant, spark paste base, fire bundle coating, ignition delay layer  
    Limitations: pitch is brittle when cold; resin flow is seasonal and localized  
    Preparation: scrape resin with bone or bark edge, warm to soften; render pitch from bark flakes over flame and store cool in wrap

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: evergreen_forest, hills

SCIENTIFIC NAME
