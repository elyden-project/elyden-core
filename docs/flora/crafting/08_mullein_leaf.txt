NAME  
    mullein_leaf - broad, woolly leaf used for wrap insulation and fire-start padding

DESCRIPTION  
    Mullein is a tall, flowering herb with large fuzzy leaves that grow in a basal rosette.  
    The leaf surface is covered in dense trichomes, making it highly absorbent and soft to the touch.  
    When dried, mullein leaves provide lightweight insulation and are useful for wrapping, lining,  
    or as padding in packs and containers. Though flammable, they are more valuable as material  
    than direct fuel. Not edible. Inhalation of smoke is discouraged.

    Found in disturbed soil, exposed slopes, or meadow edge zones.  
    Leaves grow low to the ground in early stages, followed by a tall central flowering spike.  
    Harvest before flowering for best texture. Dry flat to preserve leaf shape and flexibility.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: packed into quivers or wrapped around gear to reduce rattle and absorb moisture  
    Thea: layered inside sling padding or used to line poultice wraps for thermal stability  
    Preparation: gather outer leaves before stalk develops, press and dry away from sunlight, fold gently if stored

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: meadow, plains

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Verbascum thapsus
