NAME  
    mullein_leaf - broad, woolly leaf used for wrap insulation and fire-start padding

DESCRIPTION  
    Mullein is a tall, flowering herb with large fuzzy leaves that grow in a basal rosette.  
    The leaf surface is covered in dense trichomes, making it highly absorbent and soft to the touch.  
    When dried, mullein leaves provide lightweight insulation and are useful for wrapping, lining,  
    or as padding in packs and containers. Though flammable, they are more valuable as material  
    than direct fuel. Not edible. Inhalation of smoke is discouraged.

    Found in disturbed soil, exposed slopes, or meadow edge zones.  
    Leaves grow low to the ground in early stages, followed by a tall central flowering spike.  
    Harvest before flowering for best texture. Dry flat to preserve leaf shape and flexibility.

USAGE  
    Used as: insulation wrap, gear lining, quiver padding, fire-start backing  
    Limitations: loses structure if sun-dried; smoke is irritating if burned  
    Preparation: gather outer leaves before flowering, press and dry in shade, fold gently if stored

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: meadow, plains
