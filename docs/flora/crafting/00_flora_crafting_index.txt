NAME  
    flora_crafting_index - flora used for construction, fiberwork, resin, or fire support

DESCRIPTION  
    This index lists plants that yield combustible, structural, or binding material.  
    Each entry reflects real-world flora adapted to local collection and reuse.

    Items include wood for shaping, bark for cordage, fibrous stalks,  
    natural resins, and desiccated matter suitable for fire starting.  
    Entries are grouped by use, not classification or origin.

    Some materials may appear in other indexes depending on preparation,  
    season, or condition. Only dry-gathered specimens are assumed viable.
