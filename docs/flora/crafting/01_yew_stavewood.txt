NAME  
    yew_stavewood - dense, flexible wood used for shaping bows and tool cores

DESCRIPTION  
    Yew is a slow-growing conifer with reddish heartwood valued for its strength and  
    elasticity. Its wood carves cleanly and resists cracking under tension, making it  
    ideal for bow construction, hafts, or reinforced bindings. Best harvested in dry,  
    cold conditions when sap content is low. Outer layers are brittle and should be  
    removed to expose the workable inner stave.

    The tree grows in scattered highland margins and forest transition zones.  
    Bark is thin and scaly. Needles are dark and flattened. Mature specimens may  
    yield one or two usable branches per season. Not suited for firewood or fiber.

USAGE  
    Used as: bow limbs, weapon hafts, structural inserts requiring elastic strength  
    Limitations: sapwood must be removed; wood must be seasoned or it will split  
    Preparation: cut from main branch, split longitudinally, and dry through one full freeze-thaw cycle

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: evergreen_forest, hills

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Taxus baccata
