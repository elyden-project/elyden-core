NAME  
    liana_bark - flexible woody vine used for cordage, binding, and strapping

DESCRIPTION  
    Lianas are long, climbing vines that form tough, fibrous outer layers.  
    When stripped and soaked, the bark can be twisted into rope, lashings, or  
    tool grips. The fiber is not load-bearing but holds well under tension.  
    Used for trap construction, bundled wrappings, or temporary fastenings.

    Found in canopy margins and humid forest underlayers.  
    Vines climb tree trunks and sprawl laterally under foliage.  
    Bark is dark, striated, and splits cleanly when scored.  
    Best harvested before drying sets in, then coiled or laid flat.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: twisted into light cord or tied around fletching bundles  
    Thea: braided into snare triggers or wrapped around tool hafts for grip  
    Preparation: cut sections under tension, strip bark with draw, soak if stiff, twist or press flat

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: wet_slope, mixed_forest

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Berchemia scandens
