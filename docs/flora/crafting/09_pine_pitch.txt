NAME  
    pine_tree - resinous highland conifer used for pitch and fire support

DESCRIPTION  
    Pine is a tall, cold-adapted conifer found in evergreen forests and upper slopes.  
    It produces thick, scaly bark and exudes amber resin at damaged sites. Resin is soft  
    when warm and brittle when cold. Bark can be rendered to extract dense, tar-like pitch  
    suitable for sealing and ignition. Both materials are valuable in survival tasks  
    requiring adhesion, waterproofing, or fire acceleration.

    Resin is scraped from natural seep or shallow cuts and stored cool. Pitch is produced  
    by boiling bark flakes or scorching over fire, then cooled and packed in bark wrap.  
    Collection is safest in dry weather from downed trees or mature specimens.  
    Pine wood is unsuitable for load-bearing use due to warping and splinter risk.  
    Resin and pitch are not interchangeable but derived from the same source.
    
USAGE  
    Mirriane: applied as sealant to arrowheads, shaft joints, and bow wrappings; pitch used to coat fire bundles  
    Thea: mixed resin used in trap adhesives or spark paste; pitch layered on trap surfaces for ignition delay  
    Preparation: scrape resin with bone or bark edge, warm to soften; for pitch, strip bark in flakes, render over fire, and store cool in bark wrap
