NAME  
    birch_peel - flammable bark sheet used for ignition, insulation, and moisture barrier

DESCRIPTION  
    Birch trees produce thin outer bark that peels in horizontal strips.  
    This bark contains volatile oils that ignite readily, even when wet.  
    Used for firestarting, temporary wrapping, or as a vapor barrier in tool construction.  
    Bark is flexible when fresh, curls and stiffens when dry. Not edible. Not load-bearing.

    Found on mature birch trunks in cool forests and upland slopes.  
    Bark is pale with horizontal lenticels and separates easily in dry air.  
    Best collected from downed trees or natural shedding, not by stripping live trunks.  
    Should be stored flat or rolled to avoid cracking.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: torn into firestarting strips or wrapped around dry tinder  
    Thea: used to line pack interiors or seal moisture-prone trap components  
    Preparation: peel flat sections, dry lightly if damp, cut to shape or fold

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: deciduous_forest, hills

SCIENTIFIC NAME
