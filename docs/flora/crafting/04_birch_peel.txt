NAME  
    birch_peel - flammable bark sheet used for ignition, insulation, and moisture barrier

DESCRIPTION  
    Birch trees produce thin outer bark that peels in horizontal strips.  
    This bark contains volatile oils that ignite readily, even when wet.  
    Used for firestarting, temporary wrapping, or as a vapor barrier in tool construction.  
    Bark is flexible when fresh, curls and stiffens when dry. Not edible. Not load-bearing.

    Found on mature birch trunks in cool forests and upland slopes.  
    Bark is pale with horizontal lenticels and separates easily in dry air.  
    Best collected from downed trees or natural shedding, not by stripping live trunks.  
    Should be stored flat or rolled to avoid cracking.

USAGE  
    Used as: firestarter, moisture barrier, interior wrap for packs or tools  
    Limitations: curls when dry; brittle if folded without warming  
    Preparation: peel flat sections, dry lightly, trim to shape or layer in wrap

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: deciduous_forest, hills

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Betula pendula
