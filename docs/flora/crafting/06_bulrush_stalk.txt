NAME  
    bulrush_stalk - tall wetland stalk used for matting, insulation, and shaft padding

DESCRIPTION  
    Bulrushes are tall, hollow-stemmed wetland plants with smooth vertical stalks.  
    When dried, the stalks are lightweight, flexible, and easy to bundle.  
    Used for padding in arrow quivers, pack insulation, woven barriers, or mat flooring.  
    Not strong enough for load-bearing construction, but useful as filler or soft-layer backing.

    Found in clusters along lake edges, stagnant shallows, and seasonal flood zones.  
    Stalks grow over a meter tall and terminate in brown or tufted seed heads.  
    Best harvested late in the season when stems are dry and pale.  
    Must be dried upright or flattened under weight to avoid warping.

USAGE  
    Used as: quiver padding, mat insulation, soft-layer filler, concealed wrap backing  
    Limitations: structurally weak; will split under stress if used while green  
    Preparation: cut at base, peel if needed, dry under shade, store bundled or pressed flat

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: lake, flood_hollow, swamp

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Schoenoplectus acutus
