NAME  
    spruce_heartwood - straight-grained conifer core used for shafts, frames, and planking

DESCRIPTION  
    Spruce produces a pale, lightweight heartwood with excellent directional strength.  
    It splits cleanly and holds shape under moderate load, making it suitable for arrow shafts,  
    struts, sled runners, and framed structures. It is not as dense as yew, but easier to  
    gather, season, and shape. Should be used dry; fresh-cut spruce may warp or split unevenly.

    Grows in dense, cold-tolerant stands at elevation or northern slope.  
    Bark is scaly and flaking; needles are four-sided and clustered around the branch.  
    Heartwood lies beneath the pale sap layer and should be taken from trunks or large limbs  
    above root flare. Burns poorly and is not suitable as kindling.

USAGE  
    Used as: arrow shafts, sled runners, structural framing under moderate load  
    Limitations: prone to warping if shaped wet; softens near heat or flame  
    Preparation: split from trunk core, debarked, and dried flat or bundled with airflow

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: evergreen_forest, glacier

SCIENTIFIC NAME
