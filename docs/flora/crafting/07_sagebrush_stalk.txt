NAME  
    sagebrush_stalk - brittle shrub stem used for fast ignition and loose tinder

DESCRIPTION  
    Sagebrush is a woody, drought-adapted shrub found across arid and wind-stripped terrain.  
    Its stems dry into hollow, brittle stalks that snap cleanly and ignite rapidly, making  
    them ideal for firestarting or padding tinder bundles. It is not suitable for structure  
    or load-bearing use. Growth is low and branching, with narrow leaves and a pungent scent  
    when disturbed. Found scattered along open slopes or exposed basins.

    Harvested stems burn hot and fast with minimal smoke.  
    Ineffective when damp and should be stored in dry wrap.  
    Adds volume to tinder but offers no sustained heat.  
    Collection is easiest by hand during dry season. 

USAGE  
    Used as: ignition material, dry tinder volume, short-burn fuel supplement  
    Limitations: ineffective when wet; not suitable for prolonged combustion  
    Preparation: snap dry stalks at base, strip side shoots, store loose in dry wrap

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: plains, hills, badlands

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Artemisia tridentata
