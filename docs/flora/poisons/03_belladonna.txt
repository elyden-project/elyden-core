NAME  
    belladonna - sedative berry-bearing plant used for disorientation and field incapacitation

DESCRIPTION  
    Belladonna is a leafy perennial with dull green foliage, bell-shaped purple flowers,  
    and glossy black berries. All parts of the plant contain tropane alkaloids, primarily atropine,  
    which interfere with neural signaling. Ingestion in small doses causes blurred vision, confusion,  
    and slowed reaction time; higher exposure results in unconsciousness or respiratory failure.

    Grows in shaded forest margins and fertile deciduous undergrowth.  
    Berries are the most concentrated delivery form, easily mistaken for edible fruit.  
    Root and leaf matter can also be dried and ground for controlled dispersal.  
    Effects vary widely based on preparation and individual tolerance.

USAGE  
    Used as: sedative agent in bait or ration tamper, hallucination inducer, field disabler  
    Limitations: delayed onset; dosage sensitive; permanent effects possible in high exposure  
    Preparation: harvest ripe berries or dry root/leaf; pulp or grind into carrier base before delivery

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: mixed_forest, deciduous_forest

SCIENTIFIC NAME
