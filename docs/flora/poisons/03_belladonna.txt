NAME  
    belladonna - sedative and deliriant used in disruption traps or target disorientation

DESCRIPTION  
    Belladonna is a branching herbaceous plant with dull green leaves and dark purple berries.  
    It contains tropane alkaloids, including atropine and scopolamine, which interfere with  
    nerve signaling and can induce blurred vision, confusion, and slowed response time.  
    Low doses may disorient or sedate; higher doses cause paralysis or hallucination.  
    Highly toxic if ingested.

    Found in forest understories with partial shade and loose soil.  
    Grows up to 1.5 meters tall. Berries are glossy, round, and deceptively sweet-looking.  
    Roots and leaves also contain active compounds. Toxin is fat-soluble;  
    care must be taken to avoid contact with eyes or broken skin.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: dried and ground for contact poison or low-dose bait tainting  
    Thea: used in confusion-based traps or infused into decoys to slow pursuit  
    Preparation: collect whole plant, dry in low light, crush berry or leaf into powder or infusion

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: mixed_forest, deciduous_forest
