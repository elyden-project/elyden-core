NAME  
    baneberry - toxic berry-producing shrub used for bait disruption and mild neurotoxic effects

DESCRIPTION  
    Baneberry is a woodland shrub producing clusters of glossy red or white berries.  
    The plant contains cardiogenic toxins that affect heart rhythm and nervous system function.  
    Berries are brightly colored to attract animals but are highly poisonous if ingested.  
    The plant grows in shaded evergreen forests and wet slopes.

    Berries and roots contain the highest concentration of toxins.  
    Handling berries may cause mild skin irritation.  
    Harvesting is hazardous due to the shrub’s low growth and toxic fruit.

USAGE  
    Used as: bait contamination, mild neurotoxin delivery, or deterrent paste component  
    Limitations: ingestion causes cardiac distress; toxins not absorbed through intact skin  
    Preparation: collect ripe berries with care, dry or crush into paste for bait application

ZONE PRESENCE
