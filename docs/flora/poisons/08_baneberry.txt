NAME  
    baneberry - cardio-depressant berry used in lethal bait or delayed disruption

DESCRIPTION  
    Baneberry is a low woodland plant with divided leaves and clustered berries.  
    The berries contain cardiogenic toxins that slow heart rate, disrupt muscle coordination,  
    and induce vomiting or collapse. In small doses, effects are delayed and subtle;  
    in concentrated form or quantity, fatal to small prey. Berries are visually attractive  
    and often mistaken for edible fruit.

    Grows in moist, shaded forest zones with loose soil.  
    Red or white berries appear late in the cycle and persist into early frost.  
    Leaves are deeply serrated and slightly hairy. Root and stem are also toxic,  
    but less potent than berries. Toxin is stable once dried or pulped.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: crushed into smear for lure trails or scent masking  
    Thea: embedded into baitballs or dried and concealed within decay traps  
    Preparation: collect whole berry clusters, dry or pulp, store in bark wrap or sealed pouch

ZONE PRESENCE

SCIENTIFIC NAME
