NAME  
    water_hemlock - highly toxic wetland root used in lethal bait and disruption traps

DESCRIPTION  
    Water hemlock is a perennial herbaceous plant with hollow, grooved stems and compound leaves.  
    It thrives in swampy and floodplain environments. The root contains cicutoxin, a potent neurotoxin  
    that causes violent convulsions and rapid death when ingested. The plant’s sap is also toxic  
    but less concentrated than root extracts.

    Found primarily in flood hollows and swamp biomes. Identification is critical due to similarity  
    with edible water parsnip. Harvesting roots requires caution and protective tools.

USAGE  
    Used as: lethal bait agent, ingestion poison, neurotoxic disruption tool  
    Limitations: toxic only when ingested; handling risks due to sap exposure  
    Preparation: excavate roots carefully, clean thoroughly, mash or blend into bait medium

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: flood_hollow, swamp

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Cicuta maculata
