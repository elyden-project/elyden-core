NAME  
    water_hemlock - high-potency neurotoxin used for kill traps and bait targeting small game

DESCRIPTION  
    Water hemlock is a tall, hollow-stemmed plant with umbrella-shaped clusters of white flowers.  
    It contains cicutoxin, a fast-acting neurotoxin that causes violent convulsions,  
    respiratory failure, and death. The root and lower stem hold the highest concentration.  
    Used for lethal bait preparation or high-fatality traps. Must be handled with extreme caution.

    Found along water margins, flood basins, and stagnant wetland edges.  
    Roots are thick and chambered, sometimes confused with edible tubers.  
    Odor is sharp and oily when cut. Toxicity remains in dried or aged specimens.  
    Causes death in small animals within minutes of ingestion.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: traced onto arrowheads or left in surface bait for predator interference  
    Thea: core component in spring barbs, wound-channel lures, or shallow pit traps  
    Preparation: harvest with bark barrier or wrapped blade, slice root, dry under airflow; never expose open skin
