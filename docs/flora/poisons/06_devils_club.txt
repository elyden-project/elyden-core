NAME  
    devils_club - thorn-covered stem used for forced movement traps and area denial

DESCRIPTION  
    Devilâ€™s club is a large, woody shrub covered in sharp spines along its stems  
    and undersides of broad leaves. The thorns cause puncture wounds, embed easily,  
    and may introduce mild irritants that lead to inflammation or infection.  
    Commonly used to block trail access, protect caches, or inflict disabling injury  
    in close-range traps.

    Found in dense, humid forest underlayers and slope margins.  
    Reaches over two meters in height. Leaves are wide and palmate,  
    resembling maple. Thick stalks snap cleanly when dry but retain spine structure.  
    Direct contact should be avoided without layered protection.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: layered across narrow gaps or used as thorn backing on ground traps  
    Thea: bound into tripline lashes or folded under foliage cover near kill zones  
    Preparation: harvest with bark gloves, strip into panels, bind while fresh, dry flat if stored

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: mixed_forest, hills

SCIENTIFIC NAME
