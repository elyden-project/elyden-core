NAME  
    devils_club - spined shrub with irritant sap used for barrier disruption and trap reinforcement

DESCRIPTION  
    Devilâ€™s club is a large, woody shrub covered in brittle yellow spines that fracture  
    on contact. It grows in dense forest undergrowth and moist hillside terrain.  
    The plant's outer surface delivers mechanical injury, while its inner sap  
    contains mild irritants that cause inflammation and rash on broken skin.  
    When processed, the stalk can be sharpened for use in trap triggers or  
    left whole to create entry deterrents.

    The plant features broad palmate leaves and red berry clusters.  
    Spines cover every part, including leaf stems and upper root crowns.  
    Handling without protection leads to embedded spines and delayed swelling.

USAGE  
    Used as: physical deterrent, spined trap anchor, or irritant-layer for path defense  
    Limitations: ineffective on heavy clothing; brittle when dry  
    Preparation: harvest live stalks, sharpen if needed, bind with cordage or embed in trigger matrix

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: mixed_forest, hills

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Oplopanax horridus
