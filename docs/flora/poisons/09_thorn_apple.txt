NAME  
    thorn_apple - deliriant seedpod used for disruption, confusion, or bait disorientation

DESCRIPTION  
    Thorn apple is a fast-growing herbaceous plant with trumpet-shaped flowers  
    and spiked seedpods. It contains tropane alkaloids such as scopolamine and atropine,  
    which interfere with memory, balance, and perception. Ingested in low doses,  
    it causes confusion and motor disruption. In higher doses, may induce delirium or collapse.  
    Not stable under heat; best used raw or in cool preparation.

    Found in disturbed ground, field margins, and nutrient-poor soil.  
    Grows low and wide with spreading leaves and prominent white or violet flowers.  
    Seedpods are round and covered in stiff thorns. All parts are toxic,  
    but seed pulp is the most potent. Odor is faintly bitter when crushed.
