NAME  
    white_snakeroot - toxic herb used for bait poisoning and muscle paralysis

DESCRIPTION  
    White snakeroot is a perennial herb with hairy stems, serrated leaves, and small white flowers.  
    It contains tremetol, a potent toxin causing muscle weakness and tremors when ingested.  
    The toxin accumulates in animal tissues and can poison predators or scavengers feeding on contaminated carcasses.  
    The plant grows in mixed forests and badlands, often under partial canopy.

    Harvest involves cutting flowering stems before seed set to maximize toxin concentration.  
    Toxicity is stable in dried plant matter and can be transferred through bait or trap coatings.

USAGE  
    Used as: bait poison, muscle paralytic agent, toxin for scavenger disruption  
    Limitations: toxin requires ingestion or prolonged contact; ineffective as contact irritant  
    Preparation: harvest stems and flowers, dry completely, grind to powder or pulp for application

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: mixed_forest, badlands

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Ageratina altissima
