NAME  
    white_snakeroot - slow-acting toxin transferred through contaminated prey tissue

DESCRIPTION  
    White snakeroot is a medium-height herb with flat clusters of white flowers and  
    pointed leaves. It contains tremetol, a toxin that passes through animal tissue  
    and causes nausea, fatigue, and long-term weakness in those who consume tainted meat.  
    Used for delayed poisoning, especially in traps that allow wounded animals to escape  
    and be recovered later after onset.

    Found in partial shade along forest edges or disturbed slopes.  
    Plants flower late in the season and grow in scattered clumps.  
    Toxin is stable in dry or dead material and remains effective after ingestion  
    by herbivores or small mammals. Not useful in contact or coating form.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: left in herbivore feeding grounds to disrupt hunting competitors  
    Thea: packed into bait near wound-based traps or tied into animal feed bundles  
    Preparation: collect leaves or stems, dry if needed, distribute around targeted ground

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: mixed_forest, badlands

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Ageratina altissima
