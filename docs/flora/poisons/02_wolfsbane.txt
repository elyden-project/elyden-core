NAME  
    wolfsbane - fast-acting neurotoxic herb used in dart coating and fatal baitwork

DESCRIPTION  
    Wolfsbane is a tall herbaceous plant with deeply cut leaves and hooded purple-blue flowers.  
    All parts contain aconitine, a highly potent alkaloid that affects nerve transmission  
    and cardiac rhythm. Exposure through ingestion or open wounds can lead to paralysis or death.  
    It is most effective when concentrated in liquid form or used as a contact toxin.

    Found in moist, shaded slopes and evergreen margins.  
    Roots and flowers contain the highest toxin levels.  
    Harvesting must be done with full hand protection; absorption through skin is possible.  
    Processing into usable extract requires minimal heat and dilution with inert binder.

USAGE  
    Used as: dart coating, ingestion poison, or lethal trap application  
    Limitations: high volatility; exposure risk during harvest and handling  
    Preparation: grind root or flower, suspend in liquid base, bind to delivery medium; avoid skin contact

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: wet_slope, evergreen_forest

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Aconitum napellus
