NAME  
    wolfsbane - cardiac toxin used for bladed traps, delayed kill coatings, or terminal bait

DESCRIPTION  
    Wolfsbane is a tall perennial herb with hooded purple-blue flowers and deeply  
    lobed leaves. All parts contain aconitine, a fast-acting neurotoxin that disrupts  
    heart rhythm and nerve conduction. Traditionally used in arrow poison and  
    lethal baiting. Toxin absorbs through skin and mucous - gloves are required  
    when handling raw plant or extract.

    Found in cold, shaded slopes and moisture-rich forest bands.  
    Plants grow from underground tubers and flower in late season.  
    Common near highland water runoffs. Root and flower are most potent.  
    Toxin degrades in heat; must be preserved cool and dry if powdered.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: applied to bladed arrowheads or used for last-shot kill delay  
    Thea: crushed and sealed into meat baits or bound into puncture trap grooves  
    Preparation: harvest whole plant with stem intact, air-dry, crush tuber or flower and apply directly
