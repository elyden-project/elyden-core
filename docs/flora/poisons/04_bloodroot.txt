NAME  
    bloodroot - caustic root used for skin disruption and blister-field deterrent

DESCRIPTION  
    Bloodroot is a small forest herb with single-lobed leaves and white spring flowers.  
    Its thick rhizome exudes a red-orange sap containing sanguinarine, a cytotoxic alkaloid  
    that destroys surface tissue on contact. Applied topically, the sap induces blistering,  
    inflammation, and tissue necrosis. Not intended for ingestion-internal use is highly toxic.

    Found in deciduous forest floors and rocky upland slopes.  
    Rhizomes grow horizontally beneath shallow soil and must be cut to activate sap flow.  
    The plant should be processed immediately after harvest to retain potency.

USAGE  
    Used as: blister trap component, surface irritant for repellents, field marker paste  
    Limitations: causes permanent scarring; ineffective when dried; dangerous if inhaled or ingested  
    Preparation: slice fresh rhizome and collect sap; apply with bone or bark tool to contact surface

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: deciduous_forest, hills

SCIENTIFIC NAME
