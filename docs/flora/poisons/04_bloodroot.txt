NAME  
    bloodroot - blistering root compound used in topical irritant traps and forced movement zones

DESCRIPTION  
    Bloodroot is a low forest plant with rounded leaves and white flowers.  
    Its thick underground rhizome produces a red-orange sap containing sanguinarine,  
    an alkaloid that causes skin irritation, tissue necrosis, or blistering on contact.  
    The sap is used to flush targets from hiding, trigger forced movement,  
    or prevent repeated use of paths and cover.

    Found in shaded slopes or wooded hillsides.  
    Emerges early in season and dies back by high heat.  
    Sap is extracted by slicing root while fresh.  
    Potency fades once dried; best used within a day unless preserved in fat or wax.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: applied to arrow shafts to trigger skin pain or grip loss  
    Thea: packed into tripline vents or folded into foliage bait along ambush corridors  
    Preparation: dig root, slice open, express fluid into wrap or smear directly onto delivery surface

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: deciduous_forest, hills

SCIENTIFIC NAME
