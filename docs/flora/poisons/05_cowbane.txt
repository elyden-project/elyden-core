NAME  
    cowbane - convulsant neurotoxin used in lethal baiting and immobilization traps

DESCRIPTION  
    Cowbane is a tall, grasslike plant with thick stems and small white flower clusters.  
    It contains cicutoxin, a highly potent compound that causes muscle spasms,  
    tremors, and respiratory failure when ingested. Toxin acts rapidly, often within minutes.  
    Roots are most dangerous but all parts are toxic. Typically used in bait-based traps  
    or crushed into short-delay kill coatings.

    Grows in standing water, shallow swamps, and wet margins of lakes.  
    Leaves are divided and resemble parsley or wild carrot.  
    Root has a strong odor and may be mistaken for edible tubers.  
    Even handling raw root may cause absorption through skin.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: minced into animal bait or smeared at trail convergence points  
    Thea: loaded into pressure-activated barbs or tissue-piercing spikebeds  
    Preparation: harvest with bark or cloth barrier, wash root, crush and bind; do not expose to heat

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: swamp, lake

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Cicuta virosa
