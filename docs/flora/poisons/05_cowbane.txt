NAME  
    cowbane - highly toxic wetland root used for lethal bait and ingestion disruption

DESCRIPTION  
    Cowbane is a tall, hollow-stemmed plant resembling wild carrot,  
    growing in saturated wetlands and lake margins. Its roots contain cicutoxin,  
    a fast-acting neurotoxin that induces convulsions, respiratory failure,  
    and death when ingested. The toxin affects central nervous system signaling  
    and is particularly potent in root material during early growth cycles.

    The plant has finely divided leaves and white umbel flowers.  
    Roots are pale, segmented, and carrot-like but exude a yellowish sap when cut.  
    Safe handling requires gloves; toxic compounds may transfer through skin cracks or mucous contact.

USAGE  
    Used as: lethal bait tamper, small-dose ration disruptor, neurotoxic pulp agent  
    Limitations: rapid onset makes dosage control difficult; not contact-effective  
    Preparation: extract root, rinse, slice thin; mash or suspend in neutral base for target delivery

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: swamp, lake

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Cicuta virosa
