NAME  
    hemlock_root - neurotoxic taproot used for sedative baiting and lethal coatings

DESCRIPTION  
    Hemlock is a tall, hollow-stemmed plant with finely divided leaves and small white  
    umbrella-shaped flowers. The root contains potent alkaloids, primarily coniine,  
    which cause progressive paralysis and respiratory failure. All parts are toxic,  
    but the root is most concentrated and traditionally used in sedative-laced bait  
    or blade coatings. Handling should be done with barrier material.

    Grows in moist lowland zones with high seasonal runoff or standing water.  
    Root is pale, tapering, and sometimes mistaken for edible wild parsnip.  
    Best harvested after flowering. Extremely dangerous if ingested unintentionally.  
    Odor is strong and mouse-like when fresh.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: mixed into bait residue or applied in trace to arrow fletch seams  
    Thea: used for paralytic trap-lacing or mixed into tissue-targeted toxin packs  
    Preparation: dig carefully, rinse with gloves or bark, air-dry root segments in shade; store sealed

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: flood_hollow, lake, swamp

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Conium maculatum
