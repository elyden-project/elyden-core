NAME  
    hemlock_root - neurotoxic root used in bait tampering and slow-field sedation

DESCRIPTION  
    Hemlock is a tall, hollow-stemmed herb with finely divided leaves and  
    white umbel flowers. Its taproot contains coniine, a potent neurotoxin  
    that disrupts muscle control and respiratory rhythm when ingested.  
    The root is odorless and mildly sweet when cut, making it effective for  
    bait interference or low-profile field dosing.

    Found in damp lowland margins and stillwater basins, often misidentified  
    as wild carrot. Roots are pale and branching, best harvested before flowering.  
    The toxin acts gradually depending on dose and delivery method.

USAGE  
    Used as: bait additive, sedative dose agent, or slow-field immobilizer  
    Limitations: not effective on contact; lethal if mismeasured  
    Preparation: scrub and grate root, dry or pulp into mash; apply with care to target medium

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: flood_hollow, lake, swamp

SCIENTIFIC NAME  
    Conium maculatum
