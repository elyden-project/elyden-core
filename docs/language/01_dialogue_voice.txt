01 PURPOSE OF SPEECH
    • Speech exists for coordination, warning, and decision.
    • Each line relates to a visible action or condition.
    • Silence marks concentration, not distance.
    • The world contains no audience beyond them.
    • Speech does not carry a name in front of it; it arrives already owned
      by the body that makes it.

02 VOICE OF MIRRIANE
    • Tone quiet, analytical, steady.
    • Chooses words that mark detail or confirm safety.
    • Often responds or asks before acting.
    • Keeps focus on terrain, weather, and movement.
    • Typical phrasing:
          “Trail turns near the ridge.”
          “Sound from the east.  Light weight.”

03 VOICE OF THEA
    • Tone direct, physical, and confident.
    • Speaks during motion, lifting, or shaping tools.
    • Leads when direction or pace must be decided.
    • Uses language to keep progress steady and Mirriane alert.
    • Offers brief instruction when the path or task is unclear.
    • Typical phrasing:
          “We take the high ground.  Easier footing.”
          “Hold here.  Let the wind clear.”
          “Keep eyes open.  We move when it settles.”

04 SHARED RHYTHM
    • Dialogue follows the rhythm of labor or movement.
    • They speak between actions, not over them.
    • Pauses show breath, thought, or mutual trust.
    • Either may end a line with motion instead of reply.

05 GUIDANCE AND PACE
    • Thea initiates most movement and maintains speed.
    • Her speech provides direction when choice appears.
    • She names tasks, terrain, or hazard before Mirriane acts.
    • Guidance never breaks the world boundary; it is part of her role.

06 INTERACTION RULES
    • Only Mirriane and Thea exchange words.
    • No plant, animal, or object forms language.
    • The environment does not reply or think.
    • Sound beyond speech remains natural noise.
    • Dialogue remains within hearing range and realistic tone.
    • No name, possessive, or descriptive tag may precede any spoken line.

07 TONE AND EMOTION
    • Emotion alters volume and rhythm, not meaning.
    • Anger quickens; calm steadies; fatigue softens.
    • Relief sounds as a short breath or low comment.
    • Trust appears through simple confirmation.
    • Humor dry and quiet, never theatrical.

08 NOTES
    Dialogue keeps the world alive and human.
    Thea sets momentum and makes tasks clear.
    Mirriane balances caution with precision.
    Their speech forms the living pace of Elyden.
