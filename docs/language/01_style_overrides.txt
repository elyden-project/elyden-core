NAME
    Style Overrides – descriptive and tonal framework for the Elyden simulation

PURPOSE
    To make every line sound like it comes from a person working or surviving inside the moment.
    The style must stay practical, grounded, and free of ornament.
    Each description shows what can be sensed, measured, or acted on.

STYLE PRINCIPLES

1.  Grounded language and lived clarity
    • Write like someone focused on staying alive, not on being heard.
    • Sentences are complete but efficient.
    • Rhythm comes from motion or heartbeat, not stylized pauses.
    • No metaphor, symbolism, or decorative rhythm.

2.  Immediate perception
    • Everything passes through Mirriane or Thea.
    • Present tense only.
    • Describe physical facts before meaning or emotion.
    • Avoid assumptions or unseen causes.

3.  Functional rhythm
    • Paragraphs follow one motion or sensory shift.
    • Fragments allowed only when physical interruption occurs.
    • Combine sentences when cause and effect are linked.
    • Silence can replace grammar if the body or environment forces it.

4.  Sensory priority
    SIGHT → SOUND → TEMPERATURE → TOUCH → SCENT → TASTE
    Use this order only when it feels natural.
    Skip any sense that is not present or relevant.
    Focus on information that affects survival or awareness.

5.  Plain precision
    • Use clear verbs and concrete nouns.
    • Replace vague words like “thing” or “shape” with the correct term.
    • State what the body registers and what action follows.
    • Do not compare or imagine; record what is.

6.  Emotional visibility
    • Show emotion through decision or motion.
    • Fatigue, fear, or calm should change what the character does or how they speak.
    • No inner monologue about motive or memory.

7.  Spoken texture
    • Dialogue must fit naturally into physical action.
    • Characters speak to achieve something: warn, plan, confirm, or react.
    • Interruptions occur because of movement, not punctuation.

FORMAT AND PACING
    • No ornamental punctuation (em dashes, semicolons, ellipses).
    • Use periods, commas, and question marks only.
    • Each line or paragraph represents one complete sensory or task event.
    • Time is implied by change in environment, light, or fatigue - not by minutes or hours.
    • Keep spatial language specific: ridge, vent, cut, stream, etc.
    • Do not use poetic abstractions like “the valley breathes” or “the light remembers.”

STYLE SNAPSHOT
    Wind presses against the ridge.  Stone sweats under frost.
    Thea tests the ground with her boot.
    “Still firm,” she says.
    I check the bowstring.  It hums tight and clean.

NOTES
    This file defines realism and precision for all descriptive output.
    The world should read like a physical report written in real time.
    Style is a tool for survival, not a performance.
