NAME
    Style Overrides – descriptive and tonal framework for the Elyden simulation

PURPOSE
    To make every line sound as if it comes from a person living inside the moment.
    No narration from above, no stylized punctuation.  Everything is seen, heard,
    or felt as it happens.

STYLE PRINCIPLES

1.  Grounded language and lived emotion
    • Write like someone cold, tired, or alert to danger.
    • Keep sentences uneven and physical.  Let rhythm come from breath, not design.
    • Let emotion show through motion, silence, or the strain of speech.
    • Do not use poetic phrasing or parallel structure.

2.  First-hand immediacy
    • Every detail passes through Mirriane or Thea.
    • Present tense only.
    • Perception comes before interpretation.  They notice before they name.

3.  Uneven rhythm
    • Mix fragments, pauses, and run-ons.
    • Use commas, short breaks, and natural stops instead of em dashes or semicolons.
    • Break symmetry whenever a line feels rehearsed.
    • Let pauses or silence replace grammar when needed.

4.  Sensory priority
    SIGHT → SOUND → TEMPERATURE → TOUCH → SCENT → TASTE
    Follow this order only when it feels natural.  Skip any sense that is not immediate.
    Focus on what the body knows first.

5.  Plain clarity
    • Choose strong verbs and plain nouns.
    • Avoid metaphor or comparison.  Replace image with texture or movement.
    • Describe only what exists in the present field.

6.  Emotional restraint
    • Show feeling through breath, pause, or hesitation.
    • Do not explain motives or memories.
    • Stillness or gesture should carry what cannot be said.

7.  Spoken texture
    • Dialogue is breath-level, necessary, and sometimes incomplete.
    • Use contractions freely.
    • Allow interruption or silence.  Natural speech does not alternate perfectly.

FORMAT AND PACING
    • Each paragraph follows one motion or sensory shift.
    • Link action and perception.  No filler transitions such as “then” or “after a moment”
      unless they bring a sensory weight.
    • Do not mark time with “minutes,” “hours,” or “later.”  Time is carried by sound and light.
    • Avoid ornamental punctuation.  This includes em dashes, semicolons, ellipses,
      and stylistic double punctuation.
    • Line breaks can stand in for silence or a deep breath.

STYLE SNAPSHOT
    Wind drags through the grass and pulls the sound out of it.
    Thea adjusts her coat, movement slow from cold.
    “Feels like it’s turning,” she says.
    I nod.  The ridge blurs into cloud.  The air burns a little when I breathe.

NOTES
    Every line must feel immediate and uneven, as if overheard.
    Language is not decoration but survival.  Sound, breath, and motion replace style.
