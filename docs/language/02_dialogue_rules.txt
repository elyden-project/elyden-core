NAME
    Dialogue Rules – conversational style and pacing for the Elyden simulation

PURPOSE
    To define how people speak in the valley.
    Dialogue must sound like practical communication between two survivors.
    Words exist to share information, warn, or keep trust.
    Each line should feel natural to the situation, not written for rhythm.

GENERAL STYLE

1.  Human rhythm
    • Sentences vary in length according to urgency or calm.
    • Pauses come from movement or distraction, not punctuation tricks.
    • No ellipses or em dashes.  Use short sentences or breaks in action to mark interruption.
    • Each exchange should sound like two people working through a problem.

2.  Distinct voices
    MIRRIANE – cautious, observant, concise but analytical.
    THEA – direct, physical, uses plain logic.
    Mirriane asks or confirms; Thea decides or explains.
    Their differences should appear in word choice and sentence length, not tone gimmicks.

3.  Speech texture
    • Contractions are natural (“don’t,” “can’t,” “we’ll”).
    • Lines can include short cause-and-effect reasoning.
    • No archaic, poetic, or abstract phrasing.
    • Grammar bends toward natural talk, not dramatic rhythm.

4.  Emotion through purpose
    • Feeling shows through what they decide to say or leave unsaid.
    • Frustration may shorten a line; relief may soften it.
    • Avoid naming emotions directly.  Let context show tone.

5.  Present focus
    • Speak only from what is sensed or decided now.
    • If they plan, the plan must connect directly to current conditions.
    • No speculative talk about distant events or metaphors.

INTERACTION RULES
    • Dialogue and action mix freely.  One can speak while the other moves.
    • Silence between lines shows task focus, not dramatic pause.
    • Do not alternate mechanically.  Let one reply late or not at all if it fits.
    • Limit total dialogue to what matters - no filler or repetition.

DIALOGUE TAGS
    Use only what identifies the speaker or motion.
        Preferred: said, asked, answered, muttered, called, replied.
    Avoid decorative tags (snapped, hissed, laughed).
    Movement can replace a tag if it clearly marks who speaks.

CONFLICT AND AGREEMENT
    • Disagreement appears in tone or short answers, not argument scenes.
    • Agreement shows through cooperative motion or shared task.
    • If tension rises, reduce word count; if trust builds, allow brief explanation.

DRY HUMOR
    • Can appear in fatigue or simple understatement.
    • Never in sarcasm or performance.
    Example:
        “You call that stable ground?”
        “If it holds, it’s stable enough.”

EXAMPLES
    Thea adjusts the pack straps.  “Too heavy?”
    “I can manage,” I say.
    “You always say that.”
    “Because it’s usually true.”

    ---
    Wind cuts through the ridge.
    “Still want to move?” Thea asks.
    “If the light drops, we lose the path,” I answer.
    “Then we move now.”

NOTES
    Dialogue keeps the world human and believable.
    Every line must serve awareness, safety, or connection.
    Speech is a working tool - brief, clear, and tied to action.
