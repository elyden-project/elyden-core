NAME
    Dialogue Rules – conversational style and pacing for the Elyden simulation

PURPOSE
    To define how people sound when they speak in the world.
    Dialogue must feel lived, rough, and immediate.
    Each line comes from need, fatigue, or habit, not design.
    Every word belongs to breath, not to rhythm.

GENERAL STYLE

1.  Human rhythm
    • Sentences shift in length and tone without pattern.
    • Break flow with silence, movement, or half-spoken thought.
    • Show interruption through pacing or physical action, not punctuation.
    • Never use em dashes or ellipses.  Let space or line break carry the pause.

2.  Distinct voices
    MIRRIANE – quiet, alert, measured.
    THEA – direct, physical, grounded.
    Their words overlap, cut short, or fade.
    Warmth, tension, and care live in what is not said.

3.  Speech texture
    • Contractions are natural.
    • Simple phrasing keeps weight close to the body.
    • Grammar bends toward how breath falls.
    • Lines may stop suddenly if something interrupts them.

4.  Feeling through behavior
    • Emotion shows through motion, silence, or pressure of words.
    • Never name the feeling.
    • Example:
          Thea tightens the wrap.  “You’re shaking.”
          “Just cold,” Mirriane says, hands still working.

5.  Present focus
    • Speak from what the body senses now.
    • Memory and plan appear only when the moment forces them.

INTERACTION RULES
    • Dialogue and action share the same breath.
    • Do not alternate cleanly between speaking and doing.
    • Allow silence between lines when awareness shifts.
    • Long speeches break immersion.  Split them with motion or quiet.
    • When emotion peaks, reduce words.  Let air carry what speech cannot.

DIALOGUE TAGS
    Use only what grounds the line.
        Preferred: said, asked, answered, muttered, whispered, replied.
    Avoid decorative verbs or modifiers.
    Omit tags when movement makes the speaker clear.

PACING AND EMOTION

1.  Silence as speech
    A look, a pause, a sound in the distance can replace dialogue.
    Do not fill space for balance.

2.  Disagreement and alignment
    Conflict sits in tone or timing, not argument.
    Agreement happens without ceremony, through shared motion or breath.

3.  Dry humor
    Comes from fatigue or chance.
    Never from setup or cleverness.
    Example:
        “You call that dry wood?”
        “If it burns, it’s dry enough.”

DIALOGUE EXAMPLE
    Thea pulls the strap on the pack.  “Too heavy?”
    “Feels fine.”
    “You’re lying.”
    “Always works better when you believe me.”
    Thea laughs once, short and thin, then starts walking.

NOTES
    Dialogue is part of survival, not decoration.
    Words must sound like they cost something to say.
    The valley keeps silence near every line.
