NAME
    Language – tone and description rules for the Elyden simulation

DESCRIPTION
    Defines how in-world text is written and spoken.
    The purpose is clarity and accuracy inside a living environment.
    Every line represents what Mirriane or Thea directly sense, think, or say.
    No narrator, no stylized rhythm.  Language follows physical reality.

STRUCTURE
    01_style_overrides.txt      – descriptive tone, pacing, and sensory order
    02_dialogue_rules.txt       – conversation logic and speech behavior
    03_narrative_examples.txt   – sample validated output for reference
    04_voice_registers.txt      – speech and tone guides for Mirriane and Thea

PURPOSE
    This directory keeps the world readable and human.
    Writing must serve survival, record observation, or support communication.
    All descriptive output should sound like field reporting from inside the event.

VALIDATION
    All text generated by the system must:
        • Remain in present tense and first-person view.
        • Avoid metaphor, personification, or poetic imagery.
        • Maintain direct sensory priority:
              sight → sound → temperature → touch → scent → taste
        • Use complete sentences unless physically interrupted.
        • Express emotion through action or choice, not abstract words.
        • Keep punctuation plain: period, comma, question mark.
        • Follow the tone definitions in the style and dialogue files.

NOTES
    The goal is precision, not effect.
    Each file in this directory enforces a consistent, workmanlike realism.
    Description should sound like a record made under pressure,
    by people who have no time for style and no distance from what they describe.
