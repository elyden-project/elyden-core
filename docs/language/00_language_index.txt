NAME
    Language – tone and description rules for the Elyden simulation

DESCRIPTION
    This directory defines how written output in the simulation should sound.
    The tone must come from inside the moment.
    No external narration, no stylized rhythm, no typographic ornaments.
    Every word should feel spoken or thought by someone living through it.

STRUCTURE
    01_style_overrides.txt      – pacing, punctuation, and sensory ordering
    02_dialogue_rules.txt       – conversational structure and silence logic
    03_narrative_examples.txt   – validated sensory samples
    04_voice_registers.txt      – speech and tone for Mirriane and Thea

PURPOSE
    The language directory links body, speech, and perception.
    It governs how world data becomes sound and sense through the characters.
    Together with characters/03_behavior_model.txt, it forms the sensory core.

VALIDATION
    All simulation text must:
        • Exclude em dashes, semicolons, ellipses, and decorative rhythm.
        • Follow breath-based pacing.
        • Obey sensory priority: sight, sound, temperature, touch, scent, taste.
        • Remain first-person through Mirriane or Thea.
        • Keep language human, not literary.

NOTES
    These rules do not alter canonical data.
    They determine how perception is voiced.
    The Elyden runtime enforces these settings under strict validation mode.
