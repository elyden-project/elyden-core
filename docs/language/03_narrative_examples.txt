NAME
    Narrative Examples – sample scenes written in the natural Elyden tone

PURPOSE
    To show how tension, emotion, and survival share the same breath.
    Every line comes from inside the moment.  Nothing stands outside or explains.
    Each scene holds movement, silence, and human weight.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
EXAMPLE 1 – BROKEN BRIDGE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Wind pulls at the bridge.  Boards slap and twist.  One plank hangs by rope.
Thea steps out first.  The sound is not wood but something tired giving up.
I stop at the edge.

She looks back.  “Come on.  It’s holding.”
“It’s not,” I say.
“It is right now.”

Her weight shifts.  The ropes groan.  Frost clings to her hair.
She grins because fear makes her grin.  “You trust me or the wind more?”

I move onto the plank.  It dips.  The world holds its breath.
When I reach her, she catches my sleeve.  Her hands shake as hard as mine.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
EXAMPLE 2 – THING IN THE SNOW
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The valley looks clean until it moves.
A dark shape pushes through the drifts, slow and heavy.
Too large for anything we hunt.

Thea lifts her axe.  Her breath breaks white.
“Don’t,” I whisper.  “It hasn’t seen us.”

The shape stops.  The head tilts.  The angle is wrong.
Sound drops away.  Even the air waits.

Thea shifts her stance.  “If it comes close-”
“It won’t.”  The words feel thin.

Wind sweeps the snow across our faces.  When it clears, nothing stands there.
Not farther off.  Just gone.

Thea exhales.  “You’re shaking.”
“Not only me,” I say.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
EXAMPLE 3 – ARGUMENT IN ICE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The shelter’s half buried.  Thea starts dragging at the beams, hands bare.
“Stop,” I say.  “You’ll break it worse.”

She pulls free.  “Then freeze if you want to think first.”

Her voice hits harder than the wind.  She keeps tearing at the wood.
Splinters flash.  The sound stings.

I move beside her, press my hand against the beam.
“Together,” I say.

She doesn’t answer but she stops fighting it.
The wall settles with a slow crack.

When it’s over she leans against me, breathing rough.
“Sorry,” she says.
“Don’t be,” I tell her.  “You were right to move.”

The word sorry stays in the air like heat.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
EXAMPLE 4 – LIGHT UNDER ICE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The lake is clear enough to see down.
Something glows there, pale and moving slow.

Thea kneels.  Her glove rests on the ice.  “It’s alive,” she says.

The light pulses once.  I can’t tell if it’s real or something the ice remembers.

“You think it’s one of the shards?”
“Maybe.  Or maybe the valley is bleeding.”

She breathes a short laugh.  “That’s worse.”

We watch it fade until only our faces remain.
They look older than we remember.

NOTES
    • Every scene carries tension, even in quiet.
    • Dialogue breaks naturally; no balanced exchange.
    • The body and the air decide the rhythm, not the sentence.NAME
    Narrative Examples – sample scenes written in the functional Elyden tone

PURPOSE
    To demonstrate practical, human language inside the world.
    Scenes focus on cooperation, humor, fatigue, and quiet trust between Mirriane and Thea.
    Description remains factual and sensory, but tone allows warmth and personality.

EXAMPLE 1 – WORKING TOGETHER
    We stack stones around the vent to slow the heat.
    Steam rolls through the gaps and burns the hands if we move too slow.

    Thea steadies the top layer.  “You’ve got better balance.”
    “Longer arms,” I say.
    She grins.  “Excuses.”

    The wall holds.  Air cools enough to breathe without sting.
    We stand close, watching the pressure settle.
    Her shoulder brushes mine when she shifts her weight.
    No words for it, but it feels steady.

EXAMPLE 2 – FORAGING
    Morning light flat across the cut.
    I kneel by the stream where frost moss grows in thick strips.
    Thea works beside me, scraping bark for kindling.

    “Smells clean today,” she says.
    “Fewer minerals in the melt.”
    “You ever think we’ll taste something that isn’t stone?”
    “Not here.”

    We gather enough to fill the cloth and tie it tight.
    When she stands, she bumps my arm on purpose.
    “Careful,” I say.
    “Making sure you’re still awake.”

EXAMPLE 3 – HUMOR IN FATIGUE
    Snow up to the knees, tools heavy with ice.
    Thea trips on a buried root and swears once, low.

    I laugh before I can stop it.
    She turns, mock glare.  “You saw nothing.”
    “Looked like tactical training.”
    “Yeah.  Ground assault.”

    We both laugh, short and tired.
    Cold air fills the sound until it fades.

EXAMPLE 4 – INTIMATE CONVERSATION
    Fire burns low.  The camp quiet except for the draw of air through the vent.

    Thea leans back on her pack.  “You ever think about before?”
    “Not much left to think about.”
    “Still.  You’d build?”
    “I’d watch.”

    She nods.  “Figures.  I build, you watch.  Same as now.”
    I smile.  “Works so far.”

    The fire cracks once, and the silence that follows feels safe.

EXAMPLE 5 – REPAIRING GEAR
    Axe head loose.  Handle split at the binding.
    Thea holds it steady while I wrap new cord.

    “You tie cleaner knots than me,” she says.
    “Archery makes the hands learn patience.”
    “Patience gets me frostbite.”
    “Speed gets you broken tools.”

    She snorts, but the smile stays.
    We finish the work in rhythm - her holding, me winding.
    The handle tightens, the axe ready again.

NOTES
    • Each scene uses realistic speech and motion.
    • Intimacy comes from shared effort, not explanation.
    • Humor appears as release, not performance.
    • Dialogue shows their bond through habit, work, and trust.
    • The tone remains plain, direct, and physical.

    • The valley never rests completely.
