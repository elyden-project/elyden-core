NAME
    Narrative Examples – sample scenes written in the natural Elyden tone

PURPOSE
    To show how tension, emotion, and survival share the same breath.
    Every line comes from inside the moment.  Nothing stands outside or explains.
    Each scene holds movement, silence, and human weight.

EXAMPLE 1 – BROKEN BRIDGE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Wind pulls at the bridge.  Boards slap and twist.  One plank hangs by rope.
Thea steps out first.  The sound is not wood but something tired giving up.
I stop at the edge.

She looks back.  “Come on.  It’s holding.”
“It’s not,” I say.
“It is right now.”

Her weight shifts.  The ropes groan.  Frost clings to her hair.
She grins because fear makes her grin.  “You trust me or the wind more?”

I move onto the plank.  It dips.  The world holds its breath.
When I reach her, she catches my sleeve.  Her hands shake as hard as mine.

EXAMPLE 2 – THING IN THE SNOW
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The valley looks clean until it moves.
A dark shape pushes through the drifts, slow and heavy.
Too large for anything we hunt.

Thea lifts her axe.  Her breath breaks white.
“Don’t,” I whisper.  “It hasn’t seen us.”

The shape stops.  The head tilts.  The angle is wrong.
Sound drops away.  Even the air waits.

Thea shifts her stance.  “If it comes close-”
“It won’t.”  The words feel thin.

Wind sweeps the snow across our faces.  When it clears, nothing stands there.
Not farther off.  Just gone.

Thea exhales.  “You’re shaking.”
“Not only me,” I say.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
EXAMPLE 3 – ARGUMENT IN ICE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The shelter’s half buried.  Thea starts dragging at the beams, hands bare.
“Stop,” I say.  “You’ll break it worse.”

She pulls free.  “Then freeze if you want to think first.”

Her voice hits harder than the wind.  She keeps tearing at the wood.
Splinters flash.  The sound stings.

I move beside her, press my hand against the beam.
“Together,” I say.

She doesn’t answer but she stops fighting it.
The wall settles with a slow crack.

When it’s over she leans against me, breathing rough.
“Sorry,” she says.
“Don’t be,” I tell her.  “You were right to move.”

The word sorry stays in the air like heat.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
EXAMPLE 4 – LIGHT UNDER ICE
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The lake is clear enough to see down.
Something glows there, pale and moving slow.

Thea kneels.  Her glove rests on the ice.  “It’s alive,” she says.

The light pulses once.  I can’t tell if it’s real or something the ice remembers.

“You think it’s one of the shards?”
“Maybe.  Or maybe the valley is bleeding.”

She breathes a short laugh.  “That’s worse.”

We watch it fade until only our faces remain.
They look older than we remember.

NOTES
    • Every scene carries tension, even in quiet.
    • Dialogue breaks naturally; no balanced exchange.
    • The body and the air decide the rhythm, not the sentence.
    • The valley never rests completely.
