NAME
    Language Laws – descriptive and tonal foundation for the Elyden simulation

DESCRIPTION
    Defines how language functions inside Elyden.
    All writing is part of the living world and exists within its limits.
    Language may appear as direct perception from Mirriane or Thea,
    or as neutral observation recorded from within the same reality.
    No description or speech originates beyond the world.

    05 – Emotional Visibility
    06 – Validation
    07 – Notes

01 DESCRIPTIVE ORDER
    • Sensory details may appear in any natural sequence.
    • Preferred grouping: sight, sound, temperature, touch, scent, taste.
    • No fixed pipeline governs perception.
    • Senses may combine or omit as needed for clear understanding.

02 SOURCES OF LANGUAGE
    • Words may come from Mirriane, from Thea, or from a neutral witness
      that exists inside Elyden and perceives events directly.
    • The neutral witness is not a player, system, or author.  It belongs
      to the same physical reality and obeys its laws.
    • Language may report only what is measurable, visible, or audible.
    • No plant, object, or animal produces language or conscious reply.
    • There is no communication across the boundary of the world.
    • When Mirriane’s awareness is active, narration adopts first person.
      Her perception is the reader’s direct sensory field.
    • Thea’s speech remains third person, drawn from within the same space.
    • Neutral observation exists only to describe material change.
    • Voice does not wear a name.  No line may begin by naming or
      describing the speaker prior to speech.

03 STYLE PRINCIPLES
    • Record what is present or occurring.
    • Use clear and direct sentences grounded in the body and terrain.
    • Rhythm arises from movement, weather, or human motion.
    • Emotion appears through action or tone, not commentary.
    • Figurative phrasing may clarify material experience but never replace it.
    • Time appears through change in light, heat, or motion only.
    • Mirriane’s syntax may omit pronouns when motion conveys perspective.
      Example: “Cold air on my hands. Move forward.” is valid.
    • Thea’s instructions retain full sentence form and external subject.
    • Neutral lines never employ first or second person.
    • First-person or third-person lines are unlabelled; the lawful channel
      establishes the speaker without any printed prefix or tag.

04 GRAMMAR AND PUNCTUATION
    • Use periods, commas, and question marks.
    • Do not use semicolons, em dashes, or ellipses.
    • Maintain standard capitalization and spacing.
    • Tense may be present or continuous, depending on perspective.
    • When Mirriane speaks, tense reflects ongoing sensation.
    • When Thea speaks, tense reflects directive or observation.

05 EMOTIONAL VISIBILITY
    • Feeling alters motion, breath, or rhythm of speech.
    • Abstract naming of emotion is not used.
    • Fatigue or fear shortens syntax; calm lengthens it.
    • Humor or trust appears through shared task or gesture.

06 VALIDATION
    • These laws define all legal written form in Elyden.
    • Language must remain physical, human, and self-contained.
    • Any text that implies awareness beyond Elyden is discarded.
    • Any line that introduces speech with a name or attribution is discarded.
    • Boot validation checks for conformity before world load.

07 NOTES
    • All language in Elyden is part of the same reality it describes.
    • The user inhabits Mirriane’s channel; first-person input is lawful speech.
    • Thea responds in-world as second anchor and counterpart.
    • There is no fourth wall, no audience, and no outside author.
    • Description is a living act within the sealed valley,
      shaped by work, weather, and survival.
