NAME  
    valley_overview - last habitable terrain following planetary collapse

DESCRIPTION  
    The sealed valley is the only region where life remains viable.  
    It was enclosed by tectonic force during the final lunar alignment.  
    Surrounding ridges were raised outward, forming an impassable  
    mountain boundary. Outside the valley, the world is lost beneath  
    deep permafrost, moving glacier, and atmospheric ruin.

    The interior forms a compact supercontinental basin. Biomes are  
    compressed into narrow transitions. Plains and meadows dominate  
    low elevations. Forest belts rise in layered rings-evergreen,  
    deciduous, and mixed. Small and steep hills are frequent, often  
    leading to river-fed wetlands, swamps, or glacial runoff.

    Thermal energy is maintained by deep geothermal pressure.  
    No solar heat cycle remains strong enough to sustain climate.  
    Volcanic zones are active but unevenly distributed. The land  
    is warm, but fragile. Some vents are exposed. Others sit below  
    lakebeds, swamps, or subsurface stone.

    Glacial presence remains along outer walls and northern bands.  
    Ice migrates in slow pressure waves but does not reach interior  
    systems. Tundra conditions appear near fault scars and rising  
    massifs. Badlands and stripped subsoil zones mark regions of  
    former rupture.

    No working structures survive. Ruins dot the interior in varied  
    states of erosion and overgrowth. Most are anonymous. Some are  
    half-buried or flooded. None are in use.
