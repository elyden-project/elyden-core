NAME  
    earthscript_vault_ruin − stratified shale formation bearing substructural glyph seams

DESCRIPTION  
    A shallow sublayer of compressed stone exposed in eroded ridgelines, gullies, and tectonic shear zones.  
    The formation reveals repeated glyph-like impressions embedded along natural sedimentary grain lines.  
    Stone between these seams is brittle and crumbles under weight, but the glyph-bearing strata remain intact.  
    Vault segments typically appear parallel to fault planes and may extend horizontally beneath hillsides.

STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES  
    • orientation: lateral along faulted strata  
    • primary material: stratified shale, partially compressed  
    • voids: narrow horizontal seams and recessed hollows  
    • glyph elements: embedded and continuous, not raised or carved  
    • thickness: varies, but consistent across layers

SURFACE TRAITS  
    • cut faces display unusually clean horizontal planes  
    • outer surfaces emit muffled knocks when impacted  
    • soil and debris resist collecting directly over glyph zones  
    • no plant penetration in affected seams  
    • fine dust collects in concentric deposition patterns

SUBSURFACE FEATURES  
    • shelf voids extend laterally along fold compression lines  
    • moisture trapped in sealed segments, no external drainage  
    • interior segments remain acoustically resonant during tectonic tremors  
    • no light absorption anomalies recorded

MATERIAL STABILITY  
    • shear fractures common near exposed glyph lines  
    • stone dust may be airborne in enclosed sites  
    • brittle lamina may collapse if unsupported  
    • no observed degradation of embedded glyph structure

NOTES  
    No fabrication evidence present; layer appears deposited, not excavated.  
    Full extent of the glyph array is unknown.  
    Identical structures logged across disparate elevations.  
    Associated lifeforms avoid direct contact with glyph-bearing seams.
