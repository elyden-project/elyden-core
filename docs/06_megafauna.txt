NAME  
    megafauna - surviving apex organisms from pre-collapse ecosystems

DESCRIPTION  
    Megafauna are large, biologically extreme creatures that persist  
    in isolated zones across the valley. They are not magical, mutated,  
    or designed. They are remnants of a time when planetary systems  
    still supported complex, energy-intensive life.

    These organisms existed prior to the collapse. Most lived in  
    marginal biomes-tundra, ash plain, deep forest, fractured slope-  
    and adapted over centuries to worsening conditions. They are rare  
    and do not congregate. Most are solitary. Each territory is large  
    and ecologically distinct.

    Their scale exceeds all other known species. Some are predatory.  
    Others defend territory aggressively. All respond to intrusion  
    with force. Movement is infrequent, often seasonal. Encounters  
    are rare and typically fatal.

    All known shards are recovered from megafauna. Each specimen  
    carries one. The method of retention is not understood.  
    Extraction is only possible after death. No other source  
    yields viable fragments.

    Their appearance evokes a familiar aura of eminence.  
    The effect is consistent, immediate, and not explained.  
    It is never discussed.
