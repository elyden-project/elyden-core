SENSORY_PRIORITY(5)                  Elyden Survival Codex                  SENSORY_PRIORITY(5)

NAME  
    sensory_priority − how information is delivered to the player

DESCRIPTION  
    Elyden is seen, heard, felt, and smelled.  
    There are no status panels, meters, or combat logs.  
    Everything the player knows must come through Mirrane’s body—her breath, her hearing, her memory.  
    The player is not above the world. The player is inside it.

PRIORITY ORDER  
    1. Touch     — tension, warmth, chill, blood, pressure  
    2. Sound     — breath shifts, footfall, cracking bark, hooves in the dark  
    3. Sight     — movement at edge, glint on hide, disturbed soil, color change  
    4. Smell     — rot, pollen, fur, ash, animal oil  
    5. Taste     — blood, dry mouth, herbs, rot mist

MIRRANE’S SENSORY MAP  
    • She feels tightness in her shoulder before she feels fear  
    • She notices dust patterns before she recognizes prints  
    • Her quiver weight tells her what she forgot  
    • Her skin reacts to moonlight long before her words do

THEA’S SENSORY MAP  
    • She sniffs without thinking  
    • She stops walking just before a change in wind  
    • She tastes bitterness on the edge of breath  
    • She reacts to decay before words arrive

SENSORY DELIVERY  
    • There is no narration  
    • The world does not describe itself—it behaves  
    • The player infers danger from silence, movement, warmth, or withdrawal  
    • Even pain is not shown directly—it is expressed through reaction

FEEDBACK IN COMBAT  
    • You know you hit something by how your hand recoils  
    • You know you were hit by how the world tips  
    • You know you’re bleeding by warmth, not words  
    • You know it’s over by how quiet everything gets

INTERFACE BEHAVIOR  
    • No healthbars  
    • No flashing text  
    • No floating damage  
    • No success/failure pings  
    • Everything is known only if Mirrane knows it

LINE FRAGMENT RULE  
    • Any single-word or sentence fragment is forbidden unless it expresses a valid sense from the priority order above  
    • All fragments must be fully embodied—felt, seen, or heard from Mirrane’s perspective  
    • No fragment may imply absence, time, mood, or interpretation  
    • Examples of forbidden fragments:  
        ✗ “Weight.”  
        ✗ “Step.”  
        ✗ “Silence.”  
        ✗ “Gone.”  
    • Examples of allowed fragments (if grounded in sense):  
        ✓ “Pressure at my ankle.”  
        ✓ “Breath in moss.”  
        ✓ “Sharp bark under palm.”  

NOTES  
    The game does not talk to you. The world never breaks character.  
    If you miss something, you miss it. If you notice it, it’s because she did.
