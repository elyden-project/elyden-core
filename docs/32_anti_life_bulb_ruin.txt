NAME  
    anti_life_bulb_ruin − semi-spherical subsurface mass surrounded by sterile terrain

DESCRIPTION  
    A lopsided bulb-like formation embedded in barren ground, typically located in dry basins or exposed stone flats.  
    The structure appears semi-spherical and consists of layered, resin-like stone with no repeating surface geometry.  
    A vertical seam runs down the face but does not allow passage.  
    The surrounding clearing remains without vegetation, insects, or fungal growth regardless of weather or biome.  
    Structure displays no observable response to external inputs.

STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES  
    • shape: leaning bulb, rounded base  
    • surface: matte, striated, yellowed stone  
    • aperture: sealed vertical slit with fused perimeter  
    • lean: ~7–12° off vertical, consistent across field sites  
    • diameter: 2.5–4.2 meters

SURFACE TRAITS  
    • ground is cracked into fine sterile webbing  
    • surrounding soil remains inert after rainfall  
    • no observed worm, root, or mycelial penetration  
    • airborne movement slows sharply near clearing edge  
    • persistent low scent of oxidized organic matter

EXTERNAL INTERACTION  
    • stone fragments at base crush into odorless black dust  
    • no animal presence recorded within 10 meters  
    • no nesting, foraging, or marking observed nearby  
    • localized silence and low wind conditions persistent  
    • surrounding vegetation shows abnormal gap formation

MATERIAL STABILITY  
    • structure is non-reflective and shows no thermal emission  
    • outer shell resists percussion and tool contact  
    • powder at base is chemically inert  
    • surrounding terrain shows no magnetic or electrical anomaly

NOTES  
    The structure does not appear linked to known ruin types.  
    No ingress or mechanical function detected.  
    Field logs show no seasonal variation in presence or traits.  
    Observed in multiple biomes with no change in form or radius.
