NAME  
    world_history - record of lunar order, the collapse of Vaeronth, and the  
                   arrival of Khyrael

DESCRIPTION  
    Elyden orbits Aurenzae, a small, steady star with pale light and  
    delayed warmth. Most planetary heat is geothermal, sustained by  
    tectonic activity and residual core convection. Aurenzae provides  
    sufficient illumination for visibility and photosynthetic processes,  
    but its thermal contribution is minimal.

    Its skies were once governed by five moons: Taeryniel, Irraketh,  
    Lovaen, Serunel, and Vaeronth. Each exhibited a distinct spectral  
    profile and orbital rhythm. Their cycles were used to track seasonal  
    drift, measure migration bands, and maintain temporal continuity. Most  
    cultures aligned their calendars, rituals, and spatial memory around  
    their appearance and phase.

    Each moon was linked to an elemental principle: earth, fire, air,  
    water, and magic. This relationship was not symbolic. Orbital resonance  
    among the five produced planetary coherence-stabilizing weather  
    systems, climate bands, biological patterning, and long-form memory.

    Vaeronth, the fifth moon, displayed erratic emission and could not be  
    consistently resolved. Its presence was considered essential to  
    mnemonic structure and arcane behavior. Without precursor, Vaeronth  
    lost cohesion and ruptured. The fragments did not disperse into deep  
    orbit. Instead, they formed a dense, stable ring structure along its  
    former trajectory. The ring remains visible and displays intermittent  
    spectral disturbance. Some cultures consider it a fractured echo of the  
    lost moon.

    After Vaeronthâ€™s collapse, Khyrael began to appear.

    It is not a moon. It does not reflect, emit, or block in any  
    conventional sense. It is seen only through distortion: a localized  
    warping of stellar backgrounds and atmospheric lensing. Its form is  
    unresolved, but appears to occupy volume without mass. It drifts at  
    irregular intervals and has no stable orbit. It does not interact with  
    the other moons.

    Khyrael is not classified among celestial bodies. Its presence is  
    associated with loss of pattern and increased environmental noise. Its  
    arrival coincides with the onset of planetary incoherence.

    The loss of Vaeronth marked the end of lunar resonance. Environmental  
    systems lost predictability. Pressure fields collapsed. Permafrost  
    advanced rapidly across midlatitudes. Agricultural timing failed.  
    Settlement patterns destabilized. Populations began to fragment.

    In their final known alignment, the four surviving moons initiated a  
    tectonic containment event. A basin was sealed at fault intersections  
    and isolated by uplifts. Within the sealed valley, environmental  
    coherence was retained. Beyond it, collapse continued.
