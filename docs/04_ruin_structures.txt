NAME  
    ruin_structures - surviving monuments to the celestial order

DESCRIPTION  
    Seven ruin sites remain across the sealed valley. Each corresponds  
    to one of the known celestial bodies: the star Aurenzae, the five  
    moons, and the anomaly Khyrael. These are not natural formations.  
    They were constructed by the ancient elemental races that once  
    inhabited the valley.

    The ruins were monuments - aligned to sky cycles, elemental  
    influence, and orbital rhythm. The ancient people named the  
    celestial bodies and built each structure to honor one of them.  
    These sites were not ceremonial. They were part of a working  
    system that regulated environmental balance through resonance.

    During the final alignment, the monuments were activated. They  
    harnessed the last energy of the moons to seal the valley and  
    raise its mountains. This act drained the celestial system. The  
    collapse followed. Civilization ended. Only the monuments remain.

    The ruins are now dormant. No text, signal, or mechanism survives.  
    Each is partially buried, fractured, or overgrown. They are still  
    structurally aligned - to star angle, seasonal shift, and orbit  
    position - but they do not glow, respond, or move. Their role in  
    the present is not understood.

    Ruin access is limited by distance, cold, and terrain. Most are  
    surrounded by hostile zones or isolated beyond safe travel.  
    Reaching them requires preparation. Interacting with them does  
    not involve puzzles or ritual. Entry is the challenge.

    Each ruin corresponds to:

        Aurenzae   - fault-rooted slant in the southern horizon  
        Taeryniel  - monolithic vault partially collapsed near uplands  
        Irraketh   - broken ring of heat-scored stone in ash field  
        Lovaen     - tilted spire scattered across a ridge fracture  
        Serunel    - basin-carved trench crossed by glacial runoff  
        Vaeronth   - sunken plate obscured by ring debris and silence  
        Khyrael    - distortion zone with no visible architecture

    All other traces of the ancient world have vanished. These ruins  
    are the last structures tied to the celestial order.
