NAME  
    hills - uneven terrain with low soil stability and limited vegetation

DESCRIPTION  
    Hills are moderate elevation zones defined by irregular slopes,  
    patchy soil retention, and surface instability. Vegetation is  
    mixed and typically sparse, with low shrubs, lichen, and  
    occasional stunted trees on plateaus or shaded slopes.

    Wind exposure is high. Water runoff is rapid. Soil erosion  
    is common on steeper grades, exposing sublayers of rock or  
    fractured sediment. Movement is viable but requires caution  
    on loose gradients or fractured ledges.

    Wildlife tends to follow ridge lines or settle in wind-sheltered  
    depressions. Visibility varies with terrain profile. Sound  
    travels unevenly across slopes. Hills may form natural corridors  
    between enclosed basins or provide access to adjacent ridgelines.
