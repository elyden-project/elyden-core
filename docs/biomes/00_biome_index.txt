NAME  
    biome_index - stable terrain zones observed within the sealed valley

DESCRIPTION  
    The valley contains multiple distinct biomes shaped by post-collapse  
    climate patterns and geothermal persistence. Each zone is a response  
    to failed planetary rhythms and residual tectonic heat.

    Biomes do not represent difficulty or progression. Conditions vary  
    locally by elevation, slope, water retention, canopy cover, and  
    seasonal exposure. No region is guaranteed safe or sustainable.

    The biomes below are canon. Additional zones may exist at margins  
    or as transient anomalies.

LIST  

    CORE ZONES  
        Plains             - open, flat terrain with minimal vegetation  
        Meadow             - seasonal lowland with shallow-rooted grasses  
        Hills              - uneven terrain with limited soil retention  
        Mixed Forest       - canopy zone with both evergreen and deciduous species  
        Evergreen Forest   - conifer-dense highland, low light, cold retention  
        Deciduous Forest   - broadleaf forest with seasonal foliage cycles  

    WET AND TRANSITIONAL  
        Swamp              - waterlogged flatland with poor drainage  
        Lake               - static freshwater body, often geothermal-fed  
        Wet Slope          - condensation-fed incline near volcanic bands  
        Flood Hollow       - seasonal depression trapping meltwater  

    COLD REGIONS  
        Tundra             - frozen subsoil zone with minimal plant structure  
        Glacier            - moving ice mass at elevation margins  
        Ice Shelf          - stable frost layer at outer periphery  
        Frost Sink         - internal basin with permanent permafrost  
        Unclimbable Ridge  - tectonic boundary beyond which no traversal is possible  

    HEAT-STRESSED AND DISTRESSED  
        Volcanic Slope     - vented terrain with geothermal instability  
        Ash Field          - sterile basin exposed to thermal decay and particulate  
        Badlands           - fractured, eroded ground with poor water retention
