NAME  
    swamp - waterlogged lowland with unstable footing and high biomass

DESCRIPTION  
    Swamps are saturated zones where groundwater or runoff collects  
    faster than it drains. Vegetation includes dense reeds, tangled  
    root systems, moss mats, and submerged debris. Tree growth is  
    stunted or irregular. Soil is loose or fully submerged.

    Movement is unpredictable. Surface stability varies with rainfall,  
    melt cycles, and geothermal flow. Visibility is compromised by  
    vegetation and elevation shifts. Standing water supports insect  
    blooms and microbial heat traps.

    Wildlife is opportunistic, amphibious, or semi-buried. Noise levels  
    are high but not reliable for detection. Encounters may occur at  
    close range with little warning. Navigation requires caution and  
    visual memory.

    Swamps typically form near lake margins, blocked hollows, or  
    shallow geothermal gradients with poor slope.
