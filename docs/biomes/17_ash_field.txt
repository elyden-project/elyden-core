NAME  
    ash_field - sterile flatland with particulate soil and residual heat

DESCRIPTION  
    Ash fields are barren zones coated in fine volcanic residue.  
    The surface is light, unstable, and wind-sensitive. Layers shift  
    with air movement, obscuring depth and any buried terrain.  
    Ground temperature varies by exposure and may retain latent heat  
    from past eruptions.

    No vegetation survives. Soil offers no nutrients or anchoring.  
    Water evaporates or pools briefly before sinking. Movement is  
    physically possible but slow due to footing inconsistency  
    and particulate drag.

    Wildlife avoids ash fields. No tracks are recorded. Pressure  
    changes may trigger minor subsidence. Visibility ranges from  
    clear to fully occluded during wind events.

    Ash fields appear near volcanic slopes, collapse basins, or  
    areas subjected to past thermal venting.

    Short-term survival is possible with thermal gear and planned withdrawal.
    No shelter or sustenance is available.
