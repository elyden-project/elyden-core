NAME  
    unclimbable_ridge - tectonic wall enclosing the valleyâ€™s outer limit

DESCRIPTION  
    The unclimbable ridge is a continuous vertical formation encircling  
    the valley. It was raised during the collapse by deep tectonic shift.  
    Faces are sheer, fractured, and without scalable features. No path  
    leads beyond. No descent has been recorded.

    The ridge blocks all visible horizon. Light behavior changes  
    near the boundary due to angle and particulate drift.  
    Wind speed intensifies along upper slopes and circulates  
    downward into interior basins.

    No vegetation grows. Surface ice forms seasonally on shaded  
    sections. Rockfall is unpredictable. Seismic echoes may  
    persist for minutes after distant impact.

    Wildlife does not approach. No structures, ruins, or  
    thermal activity are found within its band.
