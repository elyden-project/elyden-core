NAME  
    volcanic_slope - geothermal incline with exposed vents and unstable crust

DESCRIPTION  
    Volcanic slopes are thermally active zones where geothermal pressure  
    reaches the surface. Rock is fractured, blackened, and irregular in  
    shape. Steam vents and minor outgassing occur without fixed pattern.  
    Vegetation is absent. Soil is replaced by brittle ash or fused slag.

    Movement is limited. Crust layers may collapse or shear with heat  
    variation. Visibility is compromised by particulate haze. Chemical  
    residue clings to clothing and equipment.

    Wildlife is absent. No foraging is possible. No structures survive.  
    The terrain resists mapping due to thermal distortion and flux.

    Volcanic slopes appear near valley faults, calderas, or buried  
    geothermal ridges. Ground temperature may exceed survivable limits  
    without warning.

    Short-term survival is possible with thermal gear and planned withdrawal.
    No shelter or sustenance is available.
