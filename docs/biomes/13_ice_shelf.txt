NAME  
    ice_shelf - static frost zone with brittle crust and sublayer voids

DESCRIPTION  
    Ice shelves are broad, stable formations of hardened frost.  
    Unlike glaciers, they do not flow or deform under pressure.  
    Surfaces are flat but fragile, often covering hollow zones  
    formed by gas pockets or past melt. Cracks propagate without  
    warning.

    Light is uniform and sound carries far. Depth perception is  
    poor due to whiteout conditions. No vegetation exists.  
    Wind exposure is constant. Snowfall layers are shallow  
    and rarely accumulate.

    Wildlife is nonexistent. Movement across the shelf is possible  
    with caution but offers no concealment or resource. Shelters  
    cannot be built. Any fall or pressure failure is unrecoverable.

    Ice shelves appear at the northern rim or in uplifted  
    interior plateaus beyond geothermal reach.

    Short-term survival is possible with thermal gear and planned withdrawal.
    No shelter or sustenance is available.
