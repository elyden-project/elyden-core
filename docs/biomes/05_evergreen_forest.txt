NAME  
    evergreen_forest - high-canopy coniferous zone with minimal undergrowth

DESCRIPTION  
    Evergreen forests form in colder elevation bands where broadleaf  
    species cannot survive. The canopy is dominated by conifers with  
    needle foliage, high vertical structure, and limited seasonal change.  
    Light penetration is low. Ground vegetation is sparse and patchy.

    Soil is acidic and retains moisture inconsistently. Organic debris  
    accumulates slowly. Underfoot terrain is often dry, rootbound,  
    and uneven. Movement is possible but visibility is reduced in  
    all directions.

    Wildlife is adapted for cold, camouflage, and stillness. Fauna  
    tend toward solitary behavior. Tracks are infrequent. Sounds  
    are muffled. Threat presence is difficult to verify without  
    direct sighting.

    Evergreen zones commonly form above mixed forest lines or along  
    high interior slopes exposed to seasonal frost.
