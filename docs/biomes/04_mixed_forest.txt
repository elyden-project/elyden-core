NAME  
    mixed_forest - transitional canopy zone with interlaced deciduous and evergreen growth

DESCRIPTION  
    Mixed forests occur where coniferous and broadleaf species coexist  
    due to overlapping temperature bands or irregular soil conditions.  
    These zones are structurally dense with layered vegetation, fallen  
    timber, and seasonal undergrowth. Ground visibility is limited.

    The canopy is inconsistent. Light penetration varies by section.  
    Moisture is retained longer than in plains or hills, supporting  
    fungi, mosses, and invertebrate biomass. Noise dampening is high.  
    Movement is possible but slow.

    Fauna density is moderate. Most species rely on cover, ambush  
    behavior, or canopy nesting. Tracks and den signs may be  
    obscured by leaf debris. Navigation without fixed landmarks  
    is unreliable.

    Mixed forests typically form between evergreen slopes and  
    deciduous lowlands, or along soil shifts in geothermal zones.
