NAME  
    tundra - cold flatland with frozen subsoil and minimal vegetation

DESCRIPTION  
    Tundra zones are open, wind-exposed regions underlain by  
    permafrost. Soil is shallow and locked for most of the year.  
    Vegetation is limited to mosses, lichens, and small cushion  
    plants. No trees survive. Color and motion are minimal.

    Surface thaw may occur briefly during geothermal surges or  
    seasonal light exposure. Drainage is poor; ice forms shallow  
    crusts above saturated ground. Terrain is flat but uneven  
    due to frost heave.

    Wildlife includes burrowers, cold-adapted grazers, and  
    occasional transient predators. Animal presence is sparse.  
    Visibility is high in clear weather but compromised by  
    snow drift or fog.

    Tundra appears near the glacial edge or in elevation zones  
    where thermal reach is minimal.
