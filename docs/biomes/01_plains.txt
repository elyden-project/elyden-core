NAME  
    plains - open lowland terrain with sparse vegetation and high exposure

DESCRIPTION  
    Plains are flat or gently rolling open regions with minimal elevation  
    change. Vegetation is discontinuous and dominated by hardy grasses,  
    root clusters, and seasonal moss layers. Canopy cover is absent.  
    Soil is shallow, brittle, and prone to wind stripping.

    Plains are subject to temperature volatility due to exposure.  
    Daytime warmth can accumulate briefly under direct light, but  
    ground heat is quickly lost. Wind shear is common. Surface  
    water is rare except during melt or runoff.

    Wildlife is limited to fast-moving grazers, subterranean feeders,  
    and insect swarms during short warm windows. Natural cover is  
    nonexistent. Any travel across plains is visible and unprotected.

    Plains typically appear between basin forests and marginal ridgelines,  
    or as internal corridors linking lowland zones.
