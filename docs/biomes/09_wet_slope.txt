NAME  
    wet_slope - geothermal incline with persistent moisture and unstable terrain

DESCRIPTION  
    Wet slopes form along inclines where geothermal condensation  
    accumulates without draining. Surface material remains damp  
    year-round. Vegetation is limited to moss layers, root nets,  
    and moisture-tolerant shrubs clinging to angled ground.

    Soil is soft, fractured, and prone to slippage. Rocks loosen  
    under minimal pressure. Mist layers reduce visibility. Movement  
    requires caution and deliberate route selection.

    Wildlife is rare and limited to small burrowers, insects, and  
    ridge-dwelling opportunists. Predators avoid the zone due to  
    noise propagation and poor footing.

    Wet slopes occur near volcanic gradients, steam-fed gullies,  
    or fractured geothermal veins. They often border swamp margins  
    or lead into flood hollows.
