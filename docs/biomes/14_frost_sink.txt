NAME  
    frost_sink - enclosed depression with persistent cold and trapped permafrost

DESCRIPTION  
    Frost sinks are internal basins where cold air and runoff settle  
    without circulation. Temperatures remain below freezing year-round.  
    Ground is locked in permafrost. Snow accumulates but does not thaw.  
    Vegetation is absent or fossilized.

    Movement is possible but dangerous. Slopes are brittle and descend  
    into flat zones with unstable ice crusts. Visibility is reduced by  
    shadow and particle reflection. Sound is muted.

    Wildlife avoids these regions. No known burrowers or surface  
    species persist. Structural remnants from pre-collapse periods  
    may be buried beneath snow layers but are inaccessible.

    Frost sinks appear as collapsed hollows within ridgelines or  
    low points in interior glacial spill zones.
