NAME  
    glacier - moving ice mass with fractured surfaces and unstable depth

DESCRIPTION  
    Glaciers are dense, slow-moving bodies of compressed ice.  
    They occupy outer elevations where geothermal heat fails to  
    reach. Surfaces are layered, cracked, and reshaped by melt,  
    refreeze, and internal pressure. No vegetation survives.  
    All features appear temporary.

    Travel is hazardous. Surface traction is minimal. Deep  
    fissures are obscured by snow crust or light distortion.  
    Sound is reflected irregularly. Light is diffuse, causing  
    directional disorientation.

    Wildlife is absent except for rare transients crossing  
    between thermal zones. Ice shifts can be silent or  
    catastrophic. No stable shelter exists.

    Glaciers form the outermost barrier between the valley  
    and the uninhabitable regions beyond.

    Short-term survival is possible with thermal gear and planned withdrawal.
    No shelter or sustenance is available.
