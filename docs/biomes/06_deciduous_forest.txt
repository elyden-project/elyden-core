NAME  
    deciduous_forest - seasonal broadleaf canopy with layered undergrowth

DESCRIPTION  
    Deciduous forests are dominated by broadleaf trees that shed foliage  
    cyclically. Canopy cover is variable throughout the year, allowing  
    significant light during bare periods and near-total shadow under  
    full growth. Leaf litter accumulates rapidly, softening ground noise  
    and obscuring surface detail.

    Soil is richer than in coniferous zones, supporting layered growth  
    including shrubs, ferns, and intermittent fungi. Water retention is  
    moderate. Movement is steady but navigation is hindered by visual  
    repetition and obscured terrain contours.

    Wildlife includes nesters, climbers, and patterned ground foragers.  
    Activity levels rise with canopy exposure. Predation is opportunistic.  
    Sound clarity depends on foliage density and time of year.

    Deciduous forests appear in lower elevations, typically downstream  
    from geothermal sources or near transitional meadows.
