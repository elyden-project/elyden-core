NAME  
    badlands - eroded terrain with fractured sediment and unstable elevation

DESCRIPTION  
    Badlands are dry, degraded zones formed by prolonged erosion and  
    runoff. Terrain consists of cracked clay, loose sediment, and  
    exposed strata. Vegetation is nearly absent. Soil structure is  
    discontinuous and collapses under weight or rainfall.

    Elevation shifts rapidly in short distances. Ravines and ridges  
    alternate without pattern. Water does not accumulate. Surface  
    is often dusty, hard-packed, or brittle. Wind exposure is high.  
    Movement is slow and unsteady.

    Wildlife is minimal, limited to scavengers and burrowers.  
    Visual landmarks are few. Ambient noise is carried far.  
    Shelter is rare and unstable.

    Badlands form in failed slopes, fossil basins, or long-term  
    drain zones where nutrients never return.
