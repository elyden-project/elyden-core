NAME  
    lake - static freshwater body with exposed perimeter and unstable margins

DESCRIPTION  
    Lakes form in natural depressions where geothermal melt or rainfall  
    accumulates. Most are isolated, shallow, and irregular in shape.  
    Water clarity varies with depth and sediment content. Shorelines  
    are uneven, shifting between firm banks, saturated soil, and silt  
    shelves prone to collapse.

    Vegetation is minimal along the interior edge but denser at outflow  
    zones. Surrounding ground may freeze seasonally, forming partial ice  
    layers that obscure depth and footing.

    Fauna include water-bound scavengers, submerged foragers, and  
    migratory feeders. Surface stillness masks movement. Visibility  
    is clear in open water but compromised near banks.

    Lakes are uncommon and usually appear at the base of hills, near  
    geothermal pockets, or within sealed depressions.
