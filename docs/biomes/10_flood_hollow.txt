NAME  
    flood_hollow - low basin with seasonal water saturation and dense vegetation

DESCRIPTION  
    Flood hollows are terrain depressions that collect water during  
    melt or rainfall cycles. Drainage is inconsistent. Pools form  
    in nested basins, intercut by root structures and soft ground.  
    During dry periods, the zone becomes muddy but remains impassable  
    at depth.

    Vegetation is thick and uneven. Growth includes tall grasses,  
    reed systems, and water-adapted brush. Tree density is low but  
    surface clutter is high. Movement is impeded. Slope direction  
    may be unclear due to basin warping.

    Wildlife includes waders, submerged foragers, and short-range  
    ambush species. Visibility is unreliable. Still water masks  
    motion and terrain hazards.

    Flood hollows typically appear between meadow zones and  
    geothermal water discharge paths.
