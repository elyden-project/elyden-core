NAME  
    meadow - open lowland with seasonal growth and shallow biodiversity

DESCRIPTION  
    Meadows are low-lying open zones with periodic moisture retention  
    and fast-growing surface vegetation. Grasses dominate, supported  
    by scattered herbs and low flowering species during brief bloom  
    periods. Tree growth is suppressed due to thin soil and hydrology.

    Water collects in shallow basins after melt or condensation cycles,  
    but drains quickly. Soil is soft and prone to saturation. Movement  
    is easy when dry but can become unstable during thaw or rainfall.

    Wildlife includes small grazers, foragers, and airborne insect  
    clusters. Predation is low but visibility is compromised by grass  
    height and terrain undulation. Cover is deceptive-low to the ground  
    but enough to obscure movement.

    Meadows occur near flood hollows, lake outlets, or as internal  
    pockets between forest and plain.
