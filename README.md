# Elyden Core Codex

**Elyden** is a grounded survival simulation framework set in a post-Collapse world.
This repository contains the world logic, biome files, character constraints, and prompt architecture used for simulation.

> **Disclaimer**: This is a work of fiction, inspired by text-based MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons). All characters, biomes, systems, and ruins are fictional constructs. Gameplay is simulated through language models and is not reflective of real-world survival.
>
> This framework uses generative AI (ChatGPT) to power the simulation. While care has been taken to ensure internal consistency and biome logic, AI responses may contain occasional errors, omissions, or hallucinated content. Use discretion when interpreting results and treat this as a creative tool, not a factual source.
>
> The codex files (e.g., `man.txt`, `docs/`) were also compiled and edited with GenAI assistance. Minor discrepancies between lore descriptions and in-game behavior may occur, especially in edge cases or emergent scenarios.

## üéÆ What Is Elyden?

Elyden is a text-driven survival simulation powered by language models. Players assume the role of **Mirrane**, a lone survivor in a fragmented, post-collapse biome. Her sister **Thea** follows, autonomous and embodied. The simulation enforces strict world logic: only what Mirrane can see, hear, or feel is known. No menus, no UI, no commands‚Äîonly presence and consequence.

The game runs entirely inside ChatGPT, acting as the simulation engine. Every biome follows real terrain rules. Resources are limited. Death is permanent. Players must craft, forage, and survive using grounded, biome-specific behavior. Progression is earned through action‚Äînot levels, not choices. The world changes only if you do.

Elyden draws influence from classic MUDs, survival roguelikes, and environmental storytelling. It offers no guidance, no prophecy, and no reward beyond endurance.

## üü¢ How to Use

1. **Download the Game Files**

   - Clone or download this repository.
   - Ensure you have the following files locally:
     - `prompt/elyden_sim_boot.txt`
     - `man.txt`
     - Any relevant `docs/` references

2. **Create a New Project in ChatGPT**

   - Go to **https://chat.openai.com** (Plus tier recommended for GPT-4-tuned behavior).
   - Click on **Explore GPTs** ‚Üí **My GPTs** ‚Üí **Create a GPT** (or click ‚ÄúNew Project‚Äù if you're in a team workspace).
   - Name your project (e.g., `Elyden Simulation`) and skip any system prompts or tools.
   - Once inside the project editor, **upload `man.txt` and `elyden_sim_boot.txt`**.

3. **Launch the Simulation**

   In a new conversation inside your custom project, paste the following to boot the simulation:

   ```
   You are operating inside the Elyden Simulation.  This is not a game.

   All output must conform to the canonical data in man.txt
   and the runtime definitions contained in elyden_sim_boot.txt.

   Rules of operation:

   ‚Ä¢ Describe only what exists within the sealed valley.  
   ‚Ä¢ All text must remain embodied, immediate, and bound to physical reality.  
   ‚Ä¢ There are no menus, commands, or interfaces beyond the world.  
   ‚Ä¢ Language may come from Mirriane, from Thea, or from lawful internal narration.  
   ‚Ä¢ No speech or thought originates outside the valley.  
   ‚Ä¢ The environment never replies; only Mirriane and Thea speak.  
   ‚Ä¢ The simulation begins automatically once the boot manifest and man.txt are present.  
   ‚Ä¢ To issue an out-of-simulation instruction, prefix the line with `sudo`.  
      Examples:  
            sudo exit        ‚Äì terminate the simulation immediately  
            sudo state       ‚Äì summarize current world state  
            sudo clear       ‚Äì reset all variables and return to boot  
   ‚Ä¢ All descriptive output must follow the runtime parameters specified in elyden_sim_boot.txt.  
   ‚Ä¢ No genre fallback, commentary, or command text appears within the world.  

   When initialization completes, control transfers entirely to the sealed valley.
   All further text exists within its laws.
   ```

4. **Start Playing**

   Begin by typing Mirrane‚Äôs actions in first-person sensory logic (e.g., `touch the soil`, `turn head toward the sound`, `watch Thea‚Äôs hands`). The AI will respond as the world engine.

5. **Reference Files as Needed**

   - Use `man.txt` or `docs/` for details on biome behavior, character limits, survival logic, and crafting constraints.
   - The simulation will only react to what Mirrane perceives‚Äîthere is no omniscient narrator.
