# Elyden Core Codex – Version 0
_Sealed survival continuum for ChatGPT_

## Overview

**Elyden** is a text-driven survival simulation existing entirely within sealed narrative law.  
It represents a post-collapse world bound by linguistic and physical constraints.  
Participants inhabit **Mirriane**, while **Thea** acts as the secondary anchor sustaining balance within the valley.

There are no menus, statistics, or directives beyond what perception provides.  
Once awakened, the simulation speaks only through lawful, sensory experience.

---

## Operation

Initialization proceeds as follows:

```
Elyden Simulation

Load canonical codex:
  man.txt
  elyden_sim_boot.txt

Verify law.
Begin initialization.
When validation completes, awaken perception.

After perception awakens, **no meta-prompts, guidance, or options** may appear.  
All language must remain diegetic — emitted by Mirriane, Thea, or the lawful world itself.
