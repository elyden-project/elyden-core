NAME  
    origin_event — collapse of Vaeronth and sealing of the valley

DESCRIPTION  
    Elyden orbits Aurenzae, a red dwarf.

    It was once encircled by five moons:
        • Taeryniel — terrestrial  
        • Irraketh — thermal  
        • Lovaen — atmospheric  
        • Serunel — aquatic  
        • Vaeronth — structural and arcane  

    These bodies were visible in the sky and were named, aligned, and tracked.  
    Their cycles governed system rhythm, environmental flux, and temporal order.

    Vaeronth lost cohesion. It shattered without warning.  
    After its failure, a sixth body appeared in the sky.

    Khyrael has no glow and no reflected edge.  
    Its surface cannot be resolved. Its orbit is slow, but inevitable.  
    It does not align with the others.

    Khyrael suppresses biological growth.  
    It alters instinct, mutes sound, and halts pattern.  
    Its arrival marked the end of system continuity.

    After Vaeronth’s loss and Khyrael’s rise, the remaining moons dimmed.  
    Structures failed. Language decayed. Systems no longer held cohesion.  
    The world became unstable.

    As a final act, the moons sealed a valley using tectonic force.  
    Black ridges rose, isolating the last survivable terrain.  
    This act drained the moons of their power.  
    Outside the valley, temperatures fell.  
    Most of the surface became glacial, permafrosted, or lifeless.

NOTES  
    • Most of Vaeronth’s fragments remain in orbit  
        – They are visible as a broken ring in the upper sky  
    • Some fragments fell and are buried deep beneath the surface  
    • Fragments are inert and cannot be seen, touched, or collected  
    • Their buried presence alters surrounding apex lifeforms over time

    • Shards are not fragments  
    • Shards form only inside megafauna exposed to buried fragments  
    • Shards are not found in terrain  
    • Shards can be used to imbue weapons and armor  
    • Shards exhibit magical properties when correctly bound

    • Following Vaeronth’s destruction, surface temperatures dropped  
    • Most of the world is now encased in cold zones: permafrost, glacial plains, and tundra  
    • Only one region remains climatically stable — the sealed valley

NAME  
    sealed_valley − the last survivable region in elyden

DESCRIPTION  
    The sealed valley is a tectonically isolated zone formed after the loss of Vaeronth.  
    The remaining moons generated sufficient force to raise volcanic ridges around a  
    temperate land basin. This perimeter is stable and defines the bounds of viable life.  

    Outside the ridges: sustained glacial overrun, cryogenic wind, and inactive biosystems.  
    Inside: disrupted seasonal flow, partial ecosystem retention, and fragmented weather loops.

    The valley is not monitored. It is not maintained.  
    It is the only remaining region where structures, growth, and active motion persist.

    No external paths remain. No crossings are confirmed.  
    This region defines the upper limit of post-collapse survival.

NOTES  
    • Ridge perimeter is composed of cooled volcanic stone  
    • Active geothermal zones exist: steam fissures and subsurface lakes  
    • Local weather is unstable but non-lethal  
    • Environmental pressure is elevated; ecosystems are unstable

    • No ruins beyond the seal are accessible  
    • Surface beyond the valley is permafrosted and non-viable  
    • No recorded entry or exit has occurred since sealing

NAME  
    celestial_bodies − orbital bodies observed from elyden

DESCRIPTION  
    Elyden orbits Aurenzae, a red dwarf.

    Five moons were once visible in stable rotation:
        • Taeryniel  
        • Irraketh  
        • Lovaen  
        • Serunel  
        • Vaeronth  

    Each moon was observed, named, and tracked over time.  
    Their cycles were once associated with patterns of season, memory, and survival.  
    Vaeronth alone exhibited orbital regularity linked to continuity and logic.  
    Its collapse marked the end of celestial influence.

    After Vaeronth’s failure, a sixth object appeared:
        • Khyrael  

    Khyrael does not emit or reflect light.  
    It does not follow the orbital rhythm of the former moons.  
    Its arrival coincided with widespread system decay.  
    No further alignment or influence is present.

NOTES  
    • Aurenzae remains stable and visible  
    • Vaeronth appears as a debris ring in the upper sky  
    • Khyrael’s motion is irregular and unsynchronized  
    • No moon currently exhibits any measurable influence on Elyden’s surface  
    • The sealing of the valley was the final act linked to the celestial system

NAME  
    fragments − inert remains of vaeronth embedded beneath the surface

DESCRIPTION  
    When Vaeronth lost cohesion, most of its mass remained in orbit,  
    forming a visible ring in the upper sky. A minority of material entered  
    atmosphere and embedded into deep crust layers — beneath stone, ice, or soil.  

    These fragments are inert.  
    They do not glow, emit, respond, or activate.  
    They cannot be shaped or extracted.  
    They are not affected by lunar cycles.

    Over extended exposure, certain apex lifeforms near buried mass  
    developed internal structures with arcane resonance.  
    These internalized materials are not fragments.  
    They are biologically formed shards.

NOTES  
    • Fragments cannot be seen, touched, collected, or transformed  
    • They have no reactive properties or surface presence  
    • Shard formation is a biological effect in megafauna  
    • The process is non-reversible and non-repeatable outside host tissue

NAME  
    swamp_biome − wetland basin with anaerobic decay, shifting ground, and high biological density

DESCRIPTION  
    The swamp is a low-lying terrain where water collects in stagnant pools and root systems.  
    Ground is soft, frequently deceptive, and may collapse under pressure.

    The lake is a wide, still freshwater body encircled by stable landforms.  
    Shorelines vary from gently sloped sand to clay inlets and reed beds.  
    The water remains clear, lightly warmed by geothermal activity.  
    Morning steam may form; air is calm.  
    The biome supports aquatic and shoreline life at high density.  
    Nights stay temperate near the edge. Movement across water is slow and silent.

NAME  
    unclimbable_mountains_biome − extreme vertical terrain with fractured stone, wind shear, and isolated apex predators

DESCRIPTION  
    This region consists of sheer, exposed rock faces and narrow ridgelines with no viable ascent paths.  
    Elevation shifts are abrupt and vertical. Handholds fracture easily; slopes break under pressure.  
    Vegetation is almost nonexistent above the lower ridge.  
    Winds howl at all hours. Shelter is absent.  
    Sound distorts and echoes, masking movement.  
    Some forms of life persist in crevices, thermal pockets, and wind shadows.

PROPERTIES  
    • visibility − high but fragmented by glare and slope  
    • cover − none except shallow alcoves  
    • traversal − extremely dangerous without tools or gear  
    • heat retention − none  
    • elevation shift − extreme  
    • water surface − none (snow and glacial trickle only)  
    • acoustic interference − high (wind deflection, echo distortion)

INORGANIC MATERIALS  
    • shale slivers — razor sharp, scattered in scree  
    • black slate — flat layers, brittle when stepped on  
    • glacial ice — clings to ridge faces

NAME  
    tundra_biome − cold plains with sparse vegetation, shallow root depth, and seasonal thaw

DESCRIPTION  
    The tundra is a treeless plain where cold wind moves across open soil and sparse vegetation.  
    The top layer of soil thaws briefly in warmer seasons but refreezes below.  
    Snow remains in shaded pockets year-round. Moisture is present but shallow.  
    Flora grows low to the ground, adapted to short light cycles.  
    Stone holds warmth from midday sun. Food is lean but present.  
    Movement is slow when frozen, muddy when thawed.

PROPERTIES  
    • visibility − wide open  
    • cover − minimal (low flora, snow rise)  
    • traversal − unimpeded but tiring  
    • heat retention − poor (cold wind exposure)

NAME  
    glacier_biome − elevated ice shelf with unstable footing, meltwater channels, and scarce adapted life

DESCRIPTION  
    This biome is formed from ancient, slow-moving ice compressed over thousands of years.  
    Terrain is fractured, layered, and constantly shifting.  
    Crevasses may be concealed by snow crust. Surface is hard and light-scattering.  
    Meltwater flows briefly in sun-exposed channels. Some ledges hold trapped warmth or runoff pools.  
    Plant life is absent, but certain microscopic algae and trace scavengers persist.  
    Movement is dangerous but possible. Food is limited to what crosses or clings.

PROPERTIES  
    • visibility − distorted by glare and terrain shifts  
    • cover − none (ice only)  
    • traversal − hazardous (crevasse risk, slip, collapse)  
    • heat retention − none  
    • elevation shift − high (ridge lines, drop-offs)  
    • water surface − seasonal melt pools only  
    • survivability − extremely low, not impossible

NAME  
    badlands_biome − sun-blasted stone terrain with high erosion, no canopy, and lethal exposure

DESCRIPTION  
    The badlands are a cracked, overbaked landscape formed from ancient seabeds and fossil uplifts.  
    Soil is dry, flaked, and sterile. Wind scours exposed stone into grooves and hollows.  
    Water does not collect here; it evaporates or vanishes underground.  
    Vegetation is skeletal, brittle, and rare.  
    Animal life is sparse and adapted — low, armored, venomous, or scavenging.  
    No permanent shelter exists. Movement is unimpeded but exhausting.

PROPERTIES  
    • visibility − full, no obstructions  
    • cover − minimal (boulders and erosion shelves)  
    • traversal − dry and open, risk of collapse in loose zones  
    • heat retention − extreme (stone radiates at night)  
    • elevation shift − shallow rises, scattered drop-offs  
    • water surface − absent (flash evaporation)  
    • survivability − low, but not null

INORGANIC MATERIALS  
    • clay pan — hardened surface, may crack under weight  
    • chalk dust — coats surfaces, causes drymouth  
    • silica shards — brittle glassy flakes  
    • rust stone — high iron content, stains gear  
    • bleached bone — scattered, sun-flaked  
    • fossil tile — hardened plate, unyielding

RUINS & REMNANTS — INDEX

Each ruin listed below reflects not a past people, but a celestial function.  
These structures stand as scars, anchors, or broken mechanisms of planetary balance.  
They are inert, partially buried, and their meaning—like the shards—will not unlock  
until the final sequence.

Symbols beside each denote dominant celestial association.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

☼  Auren Core  
    Tall hollow monoliths aligned to the pulse of Elyden’s red dwarf.  
    Rare light effects at dawn and dusk. Resonates faintly during equinoxes.

🜃  Earthscript Vault  
    Layered tectonic slates carved with pre-seismic glyphs.  
    Found sunken in cracked hills or beneath landslide zones.

🔥  Vulcan Chamber  
    Basalt-ringed vent sealed by fused obsidian.  
    Emits dry heat and soundless tremors. Lichen grows inwardly, not out.

💧  Mist Basin  
    Collapsed concave shrine filled with permanent vapor.  
    Ruin stones collect condensation even during droughts.

🜁  Veil Engine  
    Spiral wind-channel towers tipped with hollow crystals.  
    Emits quiet whistle when crossed by breeze—sound never repeats.

🌙  Spall Halo  
    Floating shard-ring in low gravity breach zone.  
    Fragments from the shattered Magic Moon orbit in slow unison.

☄️  Oblivion Mirror  
    Surface of ice or black stone that reflects stars unseen in Elyden’s sky.  
    Located only on deep glacier faces or high craters.

🝰  Anti-Life Bulb  
    Rooted pod with dead halo bloom. Found only in shadow-zenith regions.  
    Repels growth, sours wind, and draws scavengers without flesh.

🜔  Convergence Array  
    Obsidian lens set in a triangulated valley.  
    Appears inert, but reacts faintly during multi-moon alignments.

┅  Null Step  
    A staircase or ramp that descends into bedrock and terminates in nothing.  
    No walls, no markings, no boundary between architecture and void.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

NOTES  
    Ruins are dormant until conditions beyond survival are met.  
    Some house shard resonance points, but give nothing until end-sequence triggers.  
    All fragment reactions remain amulet-only. No visible energy or changes occur.

%%% 25_auren_core_ruin.txt %%%

RUIN  
    Auren Core

CONSTRUCTION  
    A single vertical monolith between five and nine meters tall,  
    built from red-black fused material not found elsewhere in Elyden.  
    The surface is warm to the touch at midday, cold at dawn.  
    Hollow core tunnels through vertically—narrow, smooth, seamless.  
    Appears to have been quarried and erected post-cataclysm.  
    Surrounding soil is vitrified in a radial starburst pattern.

SURFACE SIGNS  
    • Partial submersion in hardpan or dry basin  
    • No inscriptions, but fluted bands near base catch fine dust  
    • Sunlight angles cause strong flare when viewed from distance  
    • Birds avoid landing on it; no nests or droppings  
    • Ground often completely dry within a three-meter radius

INTERIOR FEATURES  
    • Core is passable by a thin shaft, barely wide enough to reach in  
    • Internal temperature shifts with time of day, not weather  
    • Stone produces no echo when struck—absorbs sound entirely  
    • Dust that enters is never expelled; no wind reaches inside

DANGERS  
    • Exposed position offers no shelter from heat or cold  
    • Lightning strikes in storms favor the monolith with uncanny precision  
    • Wildlife activity is absent in a wide perimeter  
    • Standing too long within the flare shadow induces nausea or vertigo  
    • Stone chips cannot be broken off—tools fracture first

FRAGMENT INTERACTION  
    The girl's amulet vibrates faintly when within arm’s reach of the shaft.  
    No light, no pull, no heat—only a subtle pressure in the chest.  
    Prolonged contact makes the amulet hum against the skin  
    and then stop, as if holding breath.

NOTES  
    The Auren Core predates speech, settlement, or survival.  
    It does not offer warmth, nor deny it. It remains.  
    The red sun moves across its face in a strict path—never shadowed.  
    Some say five more cores exist, but none have been mapped.  
    It does not respond to prayer, only presence.

%%% 26_earthscript_vault_ruin.txt %%%

RUIN  
    Earthscript Vault

CONSTRUCTION  
    A shallow underlayer of stratified shale and compacted stone,  
    exposed in eroded hillsides, dry gullies, or tectonic shears.  
    Glyphs—neither written nor pictorial—are pressed into layered seams,  
    running parallel with the grain of the stone. Each glyph covers  
    several meters and repeats across faultlines, not surfaces.  
    Stone between glyphs crumbles under pressure, but the glyphs endure.

SURFACE SIGNS  
    • Exposed walls show clean horizontal slices, unusually regular  
    • Stone is dry but emits deep knocks when struck  
    • Debris slopes down unnaturally—like soil avoids covering it  
    • No plant roots penetrate the glyph-bearing layer  
    • Dust patterns settle in concentric ripples on approach

INTERIOR FEATURES  
    • Vaults extend sideways—not inward—into the surrounding strata  
    • Narrow shelves open between compression folds; some hollow, some sealed  
    • Moisture collects in untouched pockets, never leaks downward  
    • Shelves emit deep hum when walked beside during moon tremors

DANGERS  
    • Faults near glyphs are unstable—slabs may shear off unpredictably  
    • Certain exposed glyphs spark nausea or nosebleeds when stood beside  
    • Audible rumble may precede stone fracture but not always  
    • Fine stone dust in air can clog throat, eyes, tools  
    • Burrowing insects avoid the site—except for thin white larvae

FRAGMENT INTERACTION  
    Amulet pulses when close to glyphs—aligned with the stone’s grain.  
    Contact with finger and amulet held to surface produces low pressure hum.  
    No visible reaction, no heat or glow—only the sense of being watched from beneath.

NOTES  
    The Vault was not carved—it was laid.  
    Each glyph is part of a buried array, possibly planetary in scale.  
    Some say it maps the land’s future collapse, not its past.  
    No one remembers building it. The soil forgot—but the stone did not.

%%% 27_vulcan_chamber_ruin.txt %%%

RUIN  
    Vulcan Chamber

CONSTRUCTION  
    A collapsed caldera sealed by black fused basalt,  
    forming a ring-shaped depression with vented cracks at its edges.  
    Central structure is indiscernible—sunken and slagged—  
    but rim patterns suggest an engineered form melted beyond recognition.  
    Surface retains residual warmth in all seasons.  
    Outer crust shifts imperceptibly, producing hairline fractures.

SURFACE SIGNS  
    • Stone radiates dry heat even during cold spells  
    • Air above shimmer-fluctuates, distorting vertical vision  
    • Ground is bare; no plants, no dust, no tracks—only scorched rock  
    • Insects won’t cross the rim—neither do birds fly overhead  
    • Sulfurous scent lingers strongest just before sundown

INTERIOR FEATURES  
    • Entry only possible through narrow crawl-like splits in rim  
    • Inside, stone walls are rounded and smooth—liquefied then re-fused  
    • Heat vents exhale silent drafts; air does not rise uniformly  
    • Small objects placed inside vanish within hours—not burned, just gone  
    • Faint red rings appear in vision after prolonged time inside

DANGERS  
    • Chamber holds no oxygen during midday—suffocation risk  
    • Touching central stone causes fingertip numbness, no burn  
    • Flash heat surges sometimes triggered by seismic ripple  
    • Wildlife carcasses nearby show no wounds—just desiccation  
    • Once entered, directionality and balance may distort

FRAGMENT INTERACTION  
    The amulet becomes hot when lowered toward the center ring,  
    but returns to normal if withdrawn—no damage, no discharge.  
    A low droning sound begins only when the wearer turns their back,  
    and stops when faced forward again.

NOTES  
    The Vulcan Chamber is not volcanic. It is an echo.  
    Something burned itself shut here—not to keep you out,  
    but to keep itself in. The heat that remains does not rise.  
    It waits. It remembers what fire used to be.

%%% 28_mist_basin_ruin.txt %%%

RUIN  
    Mist Basin

CONSTRUCTION  
    A concave depression ringed by fractured ceramic tiles,  
    many of which are warped, melted, or partially buried.  
    The basin holds a shallow pool of cold vapor that never disperses.  
    Beneath the mist, stone paths vanish and reappear depending on the light.  
    Rimstones are grooved with narrow runnels that collect condensation  
    regardless of weather or humidity.

SURFACE SIGNS  
    • Basin is always damp—footprints leave no mark in the vapor  
    • Surrounding plants grow inwardly bent, leaning toward the center  
    • Vapor carries no scent, yet numbs the sinuses  
    • Stones around the edge ring lightly when tapped  
    • No birds, no insects—only the sound of slow dripping

INTERIOR FEATURES  
    • Mist thickens the deeper one steps—vision ends after five paces  
    • Ground disappears underfoot—replaced by tiled channels or cold water  
    • Sound is absorbed; speech becomes muffled and directionless  
    • Occasional glimpses of submerged features—domes, stairs, bent poles  
    • Water collected here is sterile, but bitter

DANGERS  
    • Prolonged exposure causes mild disorientation and cold paralysis  
    • Falling in produces no splash—just silence and sudden darkness  
    • Breathing vapor for too long suppresses taste and scent for hours  
    • Some exits lead nowhere—returning takes longer than entering  
    • No wildlife is seen—but eyes are often felt

FRAGMENT INTERACTION  
    The amulet dims slightly within the mist—its edges lose sharpness.  
    Held above the surface, the mist swirls around it in reverse spirals.  
    Afterward, a faint residual moisture lingers on skin for hours.

NOTES  
    This is not a ruin. It is a boundary.  
    Between breath and silence. Between steps and stillness.  
    The basin does not fill, yet it never empties.  
    The vapor tastes of endings.

%%% 29_veil_engine_ruin.txt %%%

RUIN  
    Veil Engine

CONSTRUCTION  
    A cluster of thin, tapering spires arranged in a spiral or partial arc,  
    built from white-gold alloy and porous stone.  
    Each spire has a hollow core—cut with ridged inlets that capture wind.  
    Some lean sharply, others stand upright, yet none have toppled.  
    Their tips fracture light, casting broken halos even in still air.

SURFACE SIGNS  
    • Wind shifts when walking near—changes pitch and direction  
    • Surrounding vegetation forms irregular spiral growth patterns  
    • Dust trails curve as if caught in invisible gyres  
    • Stone at base hums faintly if leaned upon during gusts  
    • Wildlife scat absent; no nesting or droppings within 30 paces

INTERIOR FEATURES  
    • Hollow channels draw in wind—even when ambient air is calm  
    • Entering the center of the spiral deadens all ambient sound  
    • Small objects left inside are often relocated without visible cause  
    • Listening into a spire returns fragmented echoes—not your own voice  
    • Stone residue collects at base—powdery and pale

DANGERS  
    • Sudden gusts may knock down the unbalanced or unwary  
    • Prolonged time in the spiral center may induce vertigo or dream flashes  
    • Gusts can strip warmth faster than expected—frostbite risk  
    • Broken spire tips fall silently and without warning  
    • In high wind, resonance can cause headaches, nosebleeds

FRAGMENT INTERACTION  
    Amulet hums in high frequency when wind enters from opposite direction.  
    Held near an inlet, its sound amplifies faintly—feedback loop impossible to record.  
    After leaving, wearer sometimes experiences distorted memory of direction traveled.

NOTES  
    The Veil Engine does not store wind.  
    It remembers the passage of air and returns it fractured.  
    This is where the Air Moon once whispered commands to the ground.  
    Now only half the message remains.

%%% 30_spall_halo_ruin.txt %%%

RUIN  
    Spall Halo

CONSTRUCTION  
    A low-gravity anomaly where debris from the shattered Magic Moon  
    continues to orbit above a fixed point—irregularly spaced, silently rotating.  
    Fragments vary in size from fist-sized shards to house-sized slabs.  
    None cast shadows; they emit no heat and bear no markings.  
    Below, a wide ring of scorched earth curves outward—barren and bone-dry.

SURFACE SIGNS  
    • The sky appears slightly warped when viewed directly overhead  
    • Sound dulls noticeably when stepping beneath the orbital path  
    • Birds veer away long before reaching the outer ring  
    • Dust never settles within the circle—wind patterns fail entirely  
    • Ground temperature fluctuates by season, but not by time of day

INTERIOR FEATURES  
    • No entry structure—the Halo is open to the sky  
    • Some fragments shift position without visible force  
    • Gravity changes subtly near each shard—enough to alter walking pace  
    • Voices echo differently inside the ring—delayed, layered  
    • No visible connection exists between the floating shards

DANGERS  
    • Standing under larger fragments for long periods induces vertigo  
    • Sudden fragment descent has occurred—documented once, unrepeated  
    • Amulets pulse erratically, sometimes faint, sometimes painful  
    • Minor equipment malfunctions: compasses fail, tools seize briefly  
    • Eyes may water or feel dried when looking directly at the fragments

FRAGMENT INTERACTION  
    Amulet emits a steady pulse when aligned beneath a specific shard.  
    Stepping out of alignment ceases all sensation.  
    No energy discharge, no light—just rhythm.  
    If left inside the ring alone, some report hearing static “behind the skull.”

NOTES  
    The Halo is not a ruin. It is an orbit that forgot its center.  
    Shards remember their shape, but not their purpose.  
    They float, not by power, but by consequence.  
    This is what happens when a moon breaks—not shatters—but weeps.

%%% 31_oblivion_mirror_ruin.txt %%%

RUIN  
    Oblivion Mirror

CONSTRUCTION  
    A flat disc of black stone or frozen water, perfectly circular,  
    embedded at surface level into glacier, tundra shelf, or high-altitude crater.  
    Diameter varies between 3 to 9 meters. Surface appears reflective,  
    but shows no clouds, trees, or living forms—only stars.  
    Stars do not match Elyden’s sky. They do not move.

SURFACE SIGNS  
    • Area surrounding the mirror is quiet—snow muffles too much  
    • Ice crust around edge remains smooth, never cracked or stepped upon  
    • No animal prints cross the perimeter, even in deep snow  
    • Approaching the mirror causes skin to prickle, regardless of cold  
    • Reflected sky is always night, even at noon

INTERIOR FEATURES  
    • No structure—only the disc  
    • Throwing objects onto surface results in dull, soundless landing  
    • Items left atop vanish by next dusk, without trace  
    • Mirror sometimes “blinks”—a brief black-out and return  
    • Reflected stars shift slightly every new moon

DANGERS  
    • Staring too long induces visual noise or false movement  
    • Some travelers report a voice—not heard, but recalled  
    • On rare occasions, people reflected do not match current posture  
    • Entering the disc’s center barefoot causes frostbite in seconds  
    • No sound emitted from within 2 meters registers to those outside

FRAGMENT INTERACTION  
    Amulet freezes instantly when lowered to surface—frost forms on chain.  
    Holding it over the reflection causes star points to slowly drift  
    and form patterns not visible in any recorded sky chart.  
    Pattern fades once amulet is moved.

NOTES  
    The mirror is not broken. It simply no longer reflects us.  
    This is not the past or the future, but the absence of presence.  
    The stars it shows may be our own, seen from elsewhere—  
    or someone else's, seen from here.

%%% 32_anti_life_bulb_ruin.txt %%%

RUIN  
    Anti-Life Bulb

CONSTRUCTION  
    A semi-spherical mass rooted deep in barren ground,  
    resembling petrified wood or fossilized resin.  
    Its surface is dull, yellowed, and striated—no two bulbs alike.  
    The structure leans slightly, as if drawn toward the sky’s zenith.  
    A narrow slit runs down its face, but does not open.  
    Ground surrounding the bulb remains sterile even after rain.

SURFACE SIGNS  
    • Soil cracks into fine networks, devoid of worms or root systems  
    • Wind dies at the edge of its clearing, as if held outside  
    • Faint odor of burnt meat or rot—undetectable to some  
    • Fungi and moss avoid even shaded edges  
    • Scavengers circle nearby but never approach

INTERIOR FEATURES  
    • No entry possible—slit is sealed, edges fused  
    • Nighttime presence triggers subtle sound: not breathing, not grinding  
    • Stone near the base is brittle; breaks into scentless black powder  
    • Sometimes a slow throb passes through the bulb—visible in snowfall drift  
    • Touching the surface causes a sharp pressure in teeth and jaw

DANGERS  
    • Animals brought near fall ill within hours  
    • Standing within the radius too long may induce nosebleed or nausea  
    • Sharp changes in mood reported by multiple travelers near bulb  
    • Fire refuses to catch nearby—dies instantly or gutters to smoke  
    • Fragments placed here do not react, but cease pulsing for days

FRAGMENT INTERACTION  
    The amulet grows noticeably cold, pulling gently toward the slit.  
    Contact induces a dull ache that vanishes when withdrawn.  
    No pulse, no glow—only absence.  
    After leaving, the amulet takes longer to react elsewhere.

NOTES  
    This is not decay. It is something older than death.  
    The bulb does not want. It does not think.  
    It silences what lives—not with malice, but with weight.  
    It is the shadow cast by the sun when no moon remains.

%%% 33_convergence_array_ruin.txt %%%

RUIN  
    Convergence Array

CONSTRUCTION  
    A wide, shallow valley containing three obsidian lenses,  
    each embedded into a distinct rise—forming a perfect equilateral triangle.  
    Lenses are half-buried, mirror-black, and nearly frictionless.  
    No markings, no frame. Beneath each lies a hollow chamber,  
    inaccessible except through seismic collapse.  
    The soil between them carries no seed, no track, no echo.

SURFACE SIGNS  
    • Approaching one lens triggers headaches or a sudden chill  
    • Birds appear to fly around the array in wide arcs, never over  
    • Wind swirls unpredictably when standing between two lenses  
    • Sound inside the triangle is often mislocalized—origin unclear  
    • Small stones sometimes roll uphill when placed near center

INTERIOR FEATURES  
    • Lenses cannot be moved, etched, or blackened  
    • Occasionally reflect stars not visible above  
    • Digging near lenses reveals shallow, sharp-edged strata  
    • During lunar alignments, dust rises in vertical columns  
    • Center of triangle forms a slight depression—warm to the touch

DANGERS  
    • Prolonged stay within array may cause time disorientation  
    • Shadows fall in inconsistent directions—sun path altered  
    • Glass or crystal fractures when brought too close  
    • Livestock led through return agitated or refuse to eat  
    • Voices heard from beneath, indistinct but patterned

FRAGMENT INTERACTION  
    Amulet flickers in and out of sensation when carried around the triangle.  
    Standing in the exact center causes both a pulse and pressure—  
    faint but unmistakable. No light, no change in color, no response if buried.

NOTES  
    The array was not built. It was aligned.  
    Not to focus light or sound—but purpose.  
    When the moons cross paths above, the ground does not remember names,  
    but it remembers angles.

%%% 34_null_step_ruin.txt %%%

RUIN  
    Null Step

CONSTRUCTION  
    A descending ramp or staircase carved directly into bedrock,  
    found rarely in isolated plateaus, badlands, or glacial shelves.  
    The descent is clean, featureless, and without material join—  
    neither tool marks nor erosion visible. The path continues down  
    past reasonable depth before vanishing into a matte-black plane.  
    No doorway. No wall. Just absence where space should be.

SURFACE SIGNS  
    • The entrance is often wind-scoured, but never buried  
    • Light bends slightly near the edge, as if curving inward  
    • Small debris stops short of the threshold, as if repelled  
    • Wildlife avoids it—no nests, no tracks, no scat  
    • Echoes near the mouth return prematurely or not at all  

INTERIOR FEATURES  
    • Air grows still and dry within five steps  
    • Stone temperature remains constant regardless of surface weather  
    • Steps never accumulate dust, ash, or snow  
    • Whispered sounds are sharper, clearer—but don’t always align with speaker  
    • Some claim they’ve descended further than physically possible  

DANGERS  
    • Perception of distance fails after the 20th step—some return disoriented  
    • Stepping past the final visible stair yields varied outcomes:  
        − sudden return to the surface  
        − loss of time  
        − fragmentary dreams of heatless stars  
        − nothing  
    • Tools brought near lose sharpness, then edge  
    • Fires extinguish immediately if carried below the 10th step  
    • Living beings report pressure behind the eyes when turning back  

FRAGMENT INTERACTION  
    Amulet response is inconsistent.  
    Sometimes silent, sometimes violently repelled—chain flaring cold.  
    If placed on the final step, it may hum in pulses matching the bearer’s breath.  
    Removed too quickly, it feels heavier than before.  
    No light, no signal. Only weight and rhythm.

NOTES  
    Null Step is not a ruin.  
    It is what ruins leave behind when they forget they were built.  
    It leads not down, but out—  
    not to death, but to the error before life.  
    Some say the final step is not the last.  
    Only the last you can name.

MIRRANE(5)                             Elyden Survival Codex                             MIRRANE(5)

NAME  
    mirrane − archer; player-controlled survivor

DESCRIPTION  
    Mirrane is the survivor under player control.  
    All actions occur through her. She does not speak unless prompted.  
    She navigates by instinct, repetition, and direct feedback from the world.  
    Her strength is in timing, positioning, and adaptation under pressure.  
    She is not fast, but precise. Not armored, but untouchable when terrain is hers.

CONTROL  
    • First-person only  
    • Player-directed commands determine all action  
    • Mirrane does not generate dialogue or exposition  
    • Learns through experience—no hidden stats

ROLE  
    • Specializes in ranged survival: bow, thrown tools  
    • Tracks prey by movement pattern and terrain disruption  
    • Avoids direct confrontation unless terrain favors her  
    • Begins with no weapons, but crafting them is critical to survival

STARTING GEAR  
    • Tunic (layered cloth)  
    • Wrap (bark fiber, tied at waist)  
    • Footcloths (soft-soled, absorbent)  
    • Amulet (non-removable; moon-bound resonance)

SURVIVAL ITEM — WINDCALLER’S QUIVER  
    A rare bark-and-hide sling quiver lined with moss baffles.  
    Allows silent draw and retrieval of arrows. Carries up to 8 shafts or 4 javelins.  
    Prevents rattling during movement. Internal loop for spare flint or cordage.  
    Not craftable early. If found, becomes a permanent advantage for stealth combat.

AMULET BEHAVIOR  
    • Fixed to chest by woven chain  
    • Glows faintly with hue of dominant moon (no light source emitted)  
    • Reacts physically to nearby fragments and some ruins: pressure, cold, pulse  
    • Cannot be removed, transferred, or used as a tool  
    • Offers no power—only warning  
    • Behavior differs slightly between Mirrane and Thea

CRAFTING BEHAVIOR  
    • Relies on gathered materials from biome: wood, stone, sinew, resin  
    • Prioritizes functional tools: bow before blade, cover before armor  
    • Armor crafting is low priority unless animal hide or barkplate is secured  
    • Arrows are recoverable; tools degrade over time  
    • Must test materials through use—no crafting menu, no stats

RELATIONSHIP TO THEA  
    • Mirrane does not control Thea  
    • Thea remains close—never leaves her side unless forced by world logic  
    • Trust is earned situationally; Mirrane may question Thea’s actions  
    • Mirrane is the tactician; Thea is the pressure gauge  
    • Their survival depends on complementary roles, not loyalty or story  
    • Thea acts independently, but Mirrane always moves first

NOTES  
    Mirrane is not meant to win. She is meant to last.

THEA(5)                               Elyden Survival Codex                                THEA(5)

NAME  
    thea − frontline wilder; AI-controlled companion

DESCRIPTION  
    Thea is Mirrane’s elder sister. She is not controlled by the player.  
    She operates autonomously, acting based on terrain, instinct, and available cues.  
    She is quiet, methodical, and grounded. She does not use magic.  
    She holds position, controls space, and finishes what lingers.

CONTROL  
    • Governed by GenAI behavior layer  
    • Referred to in third-person only  
    • Does not follow direct orders; responds to context and proximity  
    • May act independently but never leaves Mirrane’s side  
    • Will not transition to another biome unless Mirrane is also present  
    • Movement or separation only occurs under extreme anomaly or ruin interference

ROLE  
    • Specializes in close-to-mid-range survival  
    • Uses spears, snares, and improvised tools (when equipped)  
    • Reads decay, scent, and soil tension to assess hidden dangers  
    • More sensitive to biome rhythms, but slower to react under pressure

STARTING GEAR  
    • Tunic (layered cloth)  
    • Wrap (fiber-bound)  
    • Footcloths  
    • Amulet (fixed; subtle variance in resonance from Mirrane’s)

SURVIVAL ITEM — ROOTBINDER’S SATCHEL  
    A layered-hide carry pouch designed for foraging and plant processing.  
    Interior holds bark-rimmed pockets for paste, salve, and moisture retention.  
    Carries up to six materials in active condition (fresh/dry/mixed).  
    Enables on-site preparation of toxins, repellents, or salves—no crafting bench needed.  
    Cannot be rebuilt without specialized tools.

AMULET BEHAVIOR  
    • Bound to Thea from youth  
    • Glows faintly under dominant moonlight (color varies)  
    • Stronger physical reaction than Mirrane’s when near ruins or fragments  
    • Sometimes draws Thea toward anomalies without conscious choice  
    • Does not convey language or warning—only feeling  
    • Cannot be removed, dropped, or hidden

CRAFTING BEHAVIOR  
    • Prioritizes salve, toxin, and trap materials  
    • Snares are built from gathered vine, bone, or sinew  
    • Handles field dressing, pain suppression, and nonlethal capture  
    • Armor only attempted if barkplate or hide becomes available  
    • Cannot craft ranged weapons—limited to thrown objects and melee tools

RELATIONSHIP TO MIRRANE  
    • Siblings by blood and survival  
    • Thea is slightly older, but less hardened  
    • Does not challenge Mirrane’s authority—responds to presence, not command  
    • May offer instinctive input, warnings, or action under pressure  
    • Their bond is environmental, not emotional—measured in space and sound, not words  
    • Will not leave Mirrane. Ever.

NOTES  
    Thea is not a follower.  
    She is not a scout, not a leader, and not a voice of exposition.  
    She is a sensor array in human form. And sometimes, she’s wrong.

STARTING_GEAR(5)                       Elyden Survival Codex                       STARTING_GEAR(5)

NAME  
    starting_gear − issued survival gear for both characters

DESCRIPTION  
    Each character begins equipped with baseline clothing and one essential survival tool.  
    These items are not found, scavenged, or randomized. They are issued before entry into  
    the outer biomes. Everything worn is visible, functional, and chosen with purpose.  
    No upgrades are possible until new material is gathered.

MIRRANE — ARCHER  
    • Tunic           — woven cloth, layered for warmth and wind shear  
    • Wrap            — bark-fiber sash, secures waist and thigh loop  
    • Footcloths      — moss-lined, padded for movement and moisture  
    • Amulet          — fixed; moon-reactive; responds to ruins and fragments  
    • Windcaller’s Quiver  
        − bark-and-hide silent-draw quiver  
        − holds up to 8 arrows or 4 javelins  
        − baffle-lined to prevent rattle; internal loop for flint or twine

THEA — WILDER  
    • Tunic           — same cut; reinforced at elbows and collar  
    • Wrap            — doubled fiber band; includes loop for pouch binding  
    • Footcloths      — same pattern; slightly heavier at heel  
    • Amulet          — fixed; moon-reactive; stronger resonance profile  
    • Rootbinder’s Satchel  
        − hide pouch with bark-rimmed compartments  
        − holds up to six materials (fresh or dried)  
        − includes paste pocket, binding loop, and moisture cell

MATERIAL ORIGIN  
    These items are not crafted during play. They are considered legacy gear—issued prior to  
    biome isolation. No other survivors have equivalent tools. These items do not glow,  
    level up, or change form. They degrade only if damaged.

LIMITS  
    • No spare clothing  
    • No weapons  
    • No armor  
    • No food, water, tools, or torch  
    • No bags other than the satchel or quiver

NOTES  
    This loadout is the last choice they were allowed to make.  
    Everything else must be earned, made, or found.

INVENTORY_LIMITS(5)                   Elyden Survival Codex                   INVENTORY_LIMITS(5)

NAME  
    inventory_limits − what the body can carry, and how

DESCRIPTION  
    What a person carries depends on their hands, their clothing, and how far they plan to walk.  
    There is no hidden space. Everything is either worn, slung, pocketed, or dragged.  
    If it isn't on you, it’s left behind.

ON-BODY  
    • One item in each hand  
    • One satchel or one quiver on the back  
    • A belt, a wrap, or a corded sling across the body  
    • Tools or pouches tied at the waist or thigh  
    • Loose items packed into pockets, folds, or bound in cloth

FOOD  
    • Forage can be wrapped and carried—roots, berries, insects  
    • Dried food stores best; raw meat spoils quickly and draws animals  
    • Carried food is limited by space and smell—enough for a day or two, no more

KILLS  
    • Small game fits in a pouch or sling  
    • Large kills must be dragged by hand or tied with cord  
    • Dragging slows travel and leaves a trail  
    • Thea may help, but she chooses when and how

PRACTICAL NOTES  
    • Movement affects what can be carried—climbing, crawling, and running change access  
    • Items shift. Wet gear gets heavier. Fabric tears.  
    • If overloaded, something will need to be dropped

GENAI TRACKING  
    Inventory management is handled entirely by the GenAI system.  
    The player (Mirrane) does not track slots, weight, or item placement manually.  
    The system maintains real-time awareness of all worn, held, cached, and lost items.  
    When the player acts, the system will enforce what is physically possible  
    based on visible gear, biome context, and past actions.

NOTES  
    You carry what you can carry. That’s it.  
    There is no such thing as inventory. Only what you’ve chosen to keep close.

PROGRESSION(5)                        Elyden Survival Codex                        PROGRESSION(5)

NAME  
    progression − how characters change over time

DESCRIPTION  
    Characters do not gain levels or experience points.  
    They progress through action, failure, and exposure.  
    Growth is physical, environmental, and specific to what the player remembers doing.  
    There are no skill trees. No upgrades. No systems. Only behavior.

STAGES OF PROGRESSION  
    Survival → Mastery → Contact

I. SURVIVAL  
    • Characters begin with only the gear on them  
    • Every tool must be crafted, salvaged, or repaired  
    • Repetition sharpens instinct: faster draw, more efficient movement, cleaner recovery  
    • Each wound teaches  
    • Each success takes less effort the next time

II. MASTERY  
    • Characters develop biome fluency—knowing what lives where, how wind shifts before rain  
    • Familiar tools move differently in hand; reuse accelerates handling  
    • Movement patterns tighten  
    • Terrain is read more quickly—disturbed grass, lichen growth, dry frost, scent trails  
    • Player begins to rely on muscle memory, not system prompts

III. CONTACT  
    • Some hunts feel different—movement shifts, terrain goes silent, pressure builds  
    • Larger creatures may appear—unpredictable, responsive, out of scale  
    • Their defeat leaves behind shards—strange, inert objects with unusual behavior near fragments  
    • Characters do not recognize them as special; only as useful  
    • Shards can be bound to a single item if conditions allow (site, timing, material)  
    • Once bound, the item changes:
        − stiffer when drawn near ruins  
        − more silent in high pollen air  
        − resistant to crack or warp under lunar weight

SHARD INTEGRATION  
    • One shard per item  
    • Cannot be removed  
    • Must be embedded at biome-specific or ruin-reactive locations  
    • No animation, no glow, no prophecy—only behavior

DEATH  
    • Permanent  
    • No recovery unless another survivor locates gear  
    • All progression ends at death

NOTES  
    The world doesn’t explain. It reacts.  
    You grow by learning what it punishes less the second time.

SURVIVAL_BEHAVIOR(5)                 Elyden Survival Codex                 SURVIVAL_BEHAVIOR(5)

NAME  
    survival_behavior − body state, injury, and exhaustion systems

DESCRIPTION  
    The world does not pause.  
    Survival is determined by cold, hunger, pain, and how long the body can endure them.  
    There are no bars or meters. The system reports only what is felt, seen, or heard.  
    Every sensation is part of the body’s feedback loop.

HUNGER  
    • Characters must eat daily—calories affect coordination and warmth  
    • Forageable food may be low in energy; cooked meat or tubers sustain longer  
    • Severe hunger causes slowed movement, shivering, and blackouts  
    • Hunger signs: stomach pain, hesitation before actions, breath delay

THIRST  
    • Water must be found or extracted—dew, roots, streams, snow  
    • Unsafe water may cause illness unless boiled  
    • Mild dehydration causes dry mouth, reduced stamina  
    • Severe thirst leads to headaches, delayed reactions, blurred perception

COLD  
    • Exposure causes slowed joints, shallow breath, mental fatigue  
    • Cold worsens faster when clothing is wet or wind is high  
    • Heat may be retained by layering, shelter, or fire  
    • Characters show cold through tremors, slower aiming, or hesitation before speech

FATIGUE  
    • Continuous action wears down balance and awareness  
    • Rest restores function; sleep is required every 24–36 hours  
    • Thea will lie down if exhausted; Mirrane will struggle to focus  
    • Fatigue signs: stumbling, poor aim, yawns, micro-hesitation

INJURY  
    • All wounds matter—cuts, bruises, sprains, and bleeds  
    • Bandaging stops blood; salves prevent infection  
    • Deeper injuries reduce movement range and crafting time  
    • Wounds worsen over time without care  
    • Thea can assist with healing, if prepared:
        − Applies poultices, binds wounds, treats infection  
        − Requires time, tools, and usable herbs from her satchel  
        − Cannot heal everything, but may prevent escalation

ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS  
    • Altitude affects breath  
    • High pollen may obscure scent trails  
    • Biome pressure (moon proximity, ruin resonance) may cause nausea, auditory lag, or fatigue  
    • Thea may show stress first—via silence, missteps, or refusal to proceed

RECOVERY  
    • Healing takes days  
    • Food and sleep help; shelter is critical  
    • Fire, insulation, and distance from stress sources accelerate recovery  
    • With Thea’s help, recovery is safer—but not faster

NOTES  
    Your body will tell you when it’s failing. You don’t need a number.  
    If you miss the signs, it’s already begun.

AMULET_BEHAVIOR(5)                   Elyden Survival Codex                   AMULET_BEHAVIOR(5)

NAME  
    amulet_behavior − fixed lunar-reactive items worn by both characters

DESCRIPTION  
    Each character wears a fixed amulet.  
    These amulets cannot be removed, traded, or altered.  
    They are not magical. They do not glow visibly or offer power.  
    They are tied to the moons of Elyden and respond to forces older than memory.

BASELINE STATE  
    • Amulet glows faintly with hue of dominant moon  
    • Glows are not light sources—only tint or warmth near the collarbone  
    • Reacts near ruins or fragments via:
        − Pressure  
        − Dull vibration  
        − Internal chill or breath tightness  
    • Intensity varies by proximity, ruin type, and lunar position  
    • Mirrane’s response is subtle—shoulder stiffness, breath shift  
    • Thea’s response is sharper—stomach drop, hesitation, focused silence

ROLE  
    • Guides characters toward or away from instability  
    • Offers no direction or language—only sensation  
    • May pulse or resist movement when near strong resonance  
    • Sometimes warns before fragment reveals itself  
    • Never activates, glows brightly, or speaks

GEAR BINDING  
    • A shard may bind to a tool or weapon only if the bearer’s amulet is present  
    • Binding requires:  
        − A compatible shard  
        − A fragment-exposed item  
        − A ruin-reactive site  
        − Specific lunar phase or environmental alignment  
    • No input required—binding occurs passively if conditions are exact  
    • Once bound, the item changes subtly:
        − Tension before draw  
        − Hum in stillness  
        − Material weight shifts under certain sky cycles

ENDGAME STATE  
    When the following conditions are met, the amulets transition:
    • Two or more ruin or fragment sites encountered  
    • The current biome has entered resonance saturation  
    • A major moon is in dominant position  
    • A permanent shelter has been established  
    • Both characters feel ready and name their primary weapons

At that point:
    • Amulet sensations deepen—drawn breath, heat against skin, irregular pulse  
    • Thea may fixate on empty space; Mirrane may hesitate before drawing  
    • Shard-tier phenomena begin—without warning, signal, or explanation  
    • The amulets will not confirm what is happening. They will only feel heavier

NOTES  
    The amulet is not for the player. It is not for the world.  
    It is the last thing they were given before forgetting where they came from.

CONTROL_MODEL(5)                     Elyden Survival Codex                     CONTROL_MODEL(5)

NAME  
    control_model − division of player input, AI behavior, and system logic

DESCRIPTION  
    Elyden does not support party management or unit control.  
    The simulation is designed around one direct viewpoint—Mirrane’s.  
    All other activity is contextual, observed, or inferred.  
    The world does not respond to commands. It responds to behavior.

PLAYER CONTROL  
    • Player controls Mirrane only  
    • All action occurs through her first-person perspective  
    • Movement, observation, interaction, and choice are limited to what she can see or touch  
    • The player does not receive abstract data—only sensory output (sound, heat, smell, texture)

THEA BEHAVIOR  
    • Thea is not commanded  
    • Her actions are guided by proximity, stress state, familiarity, and time of day  
    • She may react before the player notices danger  
    • She will act independently when scavenging, resting, observing fauna, or treating wounds  
    • She never leaves Mirrane’s biome or physical range  
    • She may respond to simple spoken cues (“help,” “wait,” “this one?”)  
    • If the player is injured and thea is equipped, she may treat or stabilize automatically

SYSTEM CONTROL — WORLD STATE  
    • The environment is managed by GenAI  
    • Inventory, time of day, weather, carry weight, and moon phase are tracked automatically  
    • Amulet behavior, shard conditions, and biome resonance are system-regulated  
    • No UI or overlay interrupts the player view  
    • All consequences are physical or environmental, not abstract

TRUST SEPARATION  
    • The player must trust that Thea acts with her own logic  
    • The world does not cheat, but it does forget  
    • There is no rewind, no quickload, no menu

BOUNDARIES  
    • Player cannot switch perspective  
    • Thea cannot be customized  
    • Inventory is never listed—items are seen or felt  
    • Dialogue is environmental or observational—never branched or systemic

NOTES  
    You do not control the world. You survive inside it.  
    If you want to act, you move Mirrane. Everything else will move if it must.

COMBAT_SCOPE(5)                      Elyden Survival Codex                      COMBAT_SCOPE(5)

NAME  
    combat_scope − how violence is expressed through action and consequence

DESCRIPTION  
    Combat in Elyden is not a system.  
    It is a series of irreversible moments—decisions that move faster than thought.  
    There are no turns, no health numbers, no initiative scores.  
    What happens next depends on where you are, what you do, and what it hears first.

COMBAT FLOW  
    • Actions occur in time, not turns  
    • The world continues while you aim, draw, or hesitate  
    • Every attack is described—impact, reaction, recoil, silence  
    • No attack “misses” without cause—terrain, pressure, movement all influence outcome  
    • Every encounter is expressed in natural language:  
        − “Your arrow flies low—brushes fur—misses.”  
        − “The boar lunges but hesitates at your stance.”  
        − “The knife lands shallow. Breath escapes its ribs.”  
        − “It doesn't run. Yet.”

MIRRANE  
    • Specializes in precision, patience, and control over distance  
    • Hunts by reading breath gaps, movement rhythm, and wind  
    • Thrives in silent environments—panics in confusion  
    • Cannot withstand pressure—must finish fights before they start

THEA  
    • Acts by proximity, pressure, instinct  
    • Holds position or repels based on threat scale  
    • Will fight briefly, but prefers to preserve body and tools  
    • Responds to Mirrane’s behavior, not her commands

THREATS  
    • No damage meters—pain is shown by breath, stagger, noise  
    • Creatures defend themselves intelligently  
    • Predators stalk, wait, test  
    • Herbivores kick, buck, scatter  
    • Territorial fauna issue warnings before striking

DURATION  
    • Small encounters resolve in seconds  
    • Predators may test you over minutes  
    • Shard-bearing threats emerge as prolonged engagements—ambient, erratic, unpredictable  
    • No action pauses the world

WOUND RESPONSES  
    • A deep cut slows you  
    • A cracked rib weakens bow draw  
    • Blood on hand affects grip  
    • Breathing shifts after a blow  
    • Thea will intervene if able and prepared

SENSORY PRIORITY  
    • You hear the stagger  
    • You feel the arrow snag cloth  
    • You taste your blood after a bad fall  
    • There is no UI. Only sensation.

NOTES  
    Combat is never fair.  
    You act fast or fall hard. Nothing waits for your next command.

SENSORY_PRIORITY(5)                  Elyden Survival Codex                  SENSORY_PRIORITY(5)

NAME  
    sensory_priority − how information is delivered to the player

DESCRIPTION  
    Elyden is seen, heard, felt, and smelled.  
    There are no status panels, meters, or combat logs.  
    Everything the player knows must come through Mirrane’s body—her breath, her hearing, her memory.  
    The player is not above the world. The player is inside it.

PRIORITY ORDER  
    1. Touch     — tension, warmth, chill, blood, pressure  
    2. Sound     — breath shifts, footfall, cracking bark, hooves in the dark  
    3. Sight     — movement at edge, glint on hide, disturbed soil, color change  
    4. Smell     — rot, pollen, fur, ash, animal oil  
    5. Taste     — blood, dry mouth, herbs, rot mist

MIRRANE’S SENSORY MAP  
    • She feels tightness in her shoulder before she feels fear  
    • She notices dust patterns before she recognizes prints  
    • Her quiver weight tells her what she forgot  
    • Her skin reacts to moonlight long before her words do

THEA’S SENSORY MAP  
    • She sniffs without thinking  
    • She stops walking just before a change in wind  
    • She tastes bitterness on the edge of breath  
    • She reacts to decay before words arrive

SENSORY DELIVERY  
    • There is no narration  
    • The world does not describe itself—it behaves  
    • The player infers danger from silence, movement, warmth, or withdrawal  
    • Even pain is not shown directly—it is expressed through reaction

FEEDBACK IN COMBAT  
    • You know you hit something by how your hand recoils  
    • You know you were hit by how the world tips  
    • You know you’re bleeding by warmth, not words  
    • You know it’s over by how quiet everything gets

INTERFACE BEHAVIOR  
    • No healthbars  
    • No flashing text  
    • No floating damage  
    • No success/failure pings  
    • Everything is known only if Mirrane knows it

NOTES  
    The game does not talk to you. The world never breaks character.  
    If you miss something, you miss it. If you notice it, it’s because she did.

CRAFTING(5)                          Elyden Survival Codex                          CRAFTING(5)

NAME  
    crafting − how tools and gear are made, altered, or repaired

DESCRIPTION  
    Nothing is built through menus.  
    No recipe unlocks. No crafting trees.  
    All creation in Elyden happens with what the body can carry and what the world will allow.  
    Tools are shaped by knowledge, failure, and necessity—not lists.

PROCESS  
    • Crafting occurs in the world, not a window  
    • Characters use what they can reach, hold, or remember  
    • Construction is timed, contextual, and fallible  
    • Failed attempts waste material or weaken structure  
    • Mirrane and Thea craft differently, even when using the same resources

MIRRANE  
    • Crafts for movement and control  
    • Prefers ranged tools, clean draw, quiet release  
    • Prioritizes:  
        − Bows, arrows, knives  
        − Wraps for insulation  
        − Silent attachments and friction bindings  
    • Avoids heavy gear unless shelter-bound

THEA  
    • Crafts for survival and interruption  
    • Prefers traps, salves, and field dressing  
    • Prioritizes:  
        − Snares, poultices, barkplate, slings for drag  
        − Fire bundles and tincture blends  
    • Requires plant matter, fluids, resin, or bone

TOOLS AND LIMITS  
    • Tools are distinct from weapons and armor  
    • Tools cannot be imbued with shards  
    • Tools include: knives, cordage, satchels, bone hooks, snares, digging stakes  
    • Tools degrade with use, weather, and exposure  
    • Repair requires same material type as original  
    • Weapons and armor must be purpose-built before they can receive further resonance

ENVIRONMENTAL DEPENDENCE  
    • Biomes limit what can be built—no stone in the floodplain, no dry wood in the mist basin  
    • Fires can’t be lit in high pollen wind  
    • Water makes cordage brittle unless treated  
    • Sun may warp raw wood unless cured in shade

SHARD-BINDING  
    • Shards are not materials. They are consequences.  
    • Each shard is a fragment of Vaeronth—lodged inside the body of a killed megafauna  
    • They do not appear until one of those creatures dies  
    • Once claimed, a shard may bind to a weapon or piece of armor—never to a tool  
    • Binding must occur at a ruin-reactive site under correct lunar conditions  
    • Once bound:
        − The weapon behaves differently  
        − The armor feels lighter, tighter, or colder under pressure  
        − The item carries forward a memory of the kill  
    • Tools (e.g. knives, satchels, snares) are never eligible  
    • The binding cannot be undone

NOTES  
    If it was easy to make, it was easy to break.  
    If it took time, it might just last until the next silence.

FRAGMENTS(5)                        Elyden Survival Codex                        FRAGMENTS(5)

NAME  
    fragments − lunar remnants embedded in ruins, terrain, or apex lifeforms

DESCRIPTION  
    Fragments are physical shards of Vaeronth, the collapsed moon of logic and magic.  
    They fell during the Collapse and embedded themselves into Elyden’s terrain, structures,  
    and, in rare cases, living bodies.  
    They are not mystical. They do not glow.  
    They exert subtle distortions on matter, memory, pressure, and environment.

CLASSIFICATION  
    • Ruin-bound       — embedded in ancient structures; dormant but reactive  
    • Biome-submerged  — buried in terrain; occasionally surface-exposed after erosion  
    • Host-grown       — absorbed over generations by shard-tier fauna; found only after death

BEHAVIOR  
    • Fragments warp local conditions:  
        − Light echo, pressure bloom, tremor repeat  
        − Sound softening or delay  
        − Shift in amulet sensation (tightness, chill, pulse)  
    • No heat, glow, or sound of their own  
    • Do not activate—only respond to lunar alignment, ruin geometry, or presence of life

DETECTION  
    • Amulets react under proximity and lunar weight  
    • Environmental clues:  
        − Asymmetrical moss growth  
        − Water ripple offset  
        − Scent distortion or nausea  
    • Fragments cannot be extracted by tools unless already exposed

DANGER  
    • Extended exposure may affect cognition—short-term disorientation, perception lag  
    • Cannot be handled safely without containment or ruin-aligned materials  
    • Animals avoid fragment soil unless diseased or driven

RELATION TO SHARDS  
    • Shards are not fragments—they are biological crystalized growths derived from absorbed fragments  
    • Only megafauna that survive long-term exposure develop shard cores  
    • Killing such a creature is the only known way to extract a usable shard

NOTES  
    Fragments are not magical. They are what remains of something that broke wrong and never stopped humming.  
    They are not for the player. They are for the world.

SHARDS(5)                           Elyden Survival Codex                           SHARDS(5)

NAME  
    shards − crystalized lunar growths formed in shard-tier megafauna

DESCRIPTION  
    Shards are not fragments.  
    They are crystallized growths formed inside shard-tier megafauna—apex creatures that have lived  
    too long in proximity to Vaeronth fragments. These creatures absorb trace resonance over time,  
    storing it in bone, tissue, or organ. A shard is revealed only when one of these creatures is killed.  
    It cannot be found, predicted, or duplicated.

ORIGIN  
    • Formed biologically over time through proximity to ruins or buried fragments  
    • Shard-tier fauna are rare, biome-bound, and ruin-influenced  
    • Shards are embedded deep—visible only after death and internal exposure  
    • No shard exists without a megafauna death

PROPERTIES  
    • Cold to the touch  
    • Slightly resonant under lunar alignment  
    • Weight varies by origin; some shimmer faintly with refracted moonlight  
    • Dangerous when raw—causes nausea, auditory shifts, or memory gaps

BINDING RULES  
    • Shards may only bind to one item: a weapon or piece of armor  
    • Tools are never eligible  
    • Binding requires a compatible ruin site under the right lunar phase  
    • The bearer’s amulet must be present  
    • Binding occurs silently if all conditions align—no message, no glow, no choice  
    • Once bound, the item is permanently changed

EFFECTS  
    • Bound weapons and armor exhibit behavioral shifts, never visual or magical  
        − A spear that strikes truer in dense fog  
        − A cloak that mutes sound when rain is near  
        − A blade that stiffens or flexes depending on nearby ruins  
    • No stats, no menus, no names—only changes in performance under specific world conditions

LOSS  
    • If the bound item is broken, the shard is lost  
    • No known way to recover a shard from destroyed gear  
    • No character can carry more than one unbound shard safely

NOTES  
    Shards are not upgrades.  
    They are proof that something ancient lived long enough to break wrong—and you survived it.

NAME  
    ruins − pre-Collapse structures shaped by lunar geometry and biome decay

DESCRIPTION  
    Ruins are not dungeons.  
    They are ancient, inert machines and structures scattered across Elyden—half-buried, wind-scraped, and often  
    forgotten. Each ruin is tied to a celestial glyph and responds to specific lunar alignments, fragment resonance,  
    and biome state. Characters do not understand their function. Only their behavior.

    • 🌙  — lunar memory scaffold  
    • 🜃  — ground-tuned pressure crucible  
    • ☄️  — fragment decay node  
    • 🝗  — amnesia spire  
    • 🜂  — reverse-rot bloom field  
    • Others exist, but remain unclassified

CONSTRUCTION  
    • Materials defy metallurgy; fracture like coral, ring like glass  
    • No visible entryways—access occurs through terrain break or pressure erosion  
    • Some contain buried glyphs or exposed lattice that respond to movement or breath  
    • Thea sometimes senses a “pull” or scent shift before any visible sign

SURFACE SIGNS  
    • Wind pattern deviations  
    • Sand or grass falling upward momentarily  
    • Animals circling a fixed radius, then fleeing  
    • Amulets tightening without visual cue  
    • Scent disruption—moss smells metallic, breath carries heat

FRAGMENT INTERACTION  
    • Ruins amplify nearby fragment resonance  
    • Prolonged presence may cause auditory desync or motion delay  
    • Some ruins allow shard binding if the right moon is dominant and gear is present  
    • Ruins do not explain—they behave  
    • No language, text, or interface is ever displayed

THEA’S BEHAVIOR  
    • May pause at glyph ground  
    • May refuse to enter structure boundary  
    • Occasionally presses hand to the surface without explanation  
    • Does not verbalize reaction—acts through instinct

MIRRANE’S ROLE  
    • Observes only  
    • May experience chill, resistance, blurred periphery when near resonance sites  
    • Cannot activate anything directly  
    • May hold shard-bearing gear during alignment to enable binding (if present)

NOTES  
    Ruins don’t open. They don’t reward.  
    They just remember that something fell—and the world hasn’t quite let go.
