NAME  
    world_history - record of lunar order, the collapse of Vaeronth, and the  
                   arrival of Khyrael

DESCRIPTION  
    Elyden orbits Aurenzae, a small, steady star with pale light and  
    delayed warmth. Most planetary heat is geothermal, sustained by  
    tectonic activity and residual core convection. Aurenzae provides  
    sufficient illumination for visibility and photosynthetic processes,  
    but its thermal contribution is minimal.

    Its skies were once governed by five moons: Taeryniel, Irraketh,  
    Lovaen, Serunel, and Vaeronth. Each exhibited a distinct spectral  
    profile and orbital rhythm. Their cycles were used to track seasonal  
    drift, measure migration bands, and maintain temporal continuity. Most  
    cultures aligned their calendars, rituals, and spatial memory around  
    their appearance and phase.

    Each moon was linked to an elemental principle: earth, fire, air,  
    water, and magic. This relationship was not symbolic. Orbital resonance  
    among the five produced planetary coherence-stabilizing weather  
    systems, climate bands, biological patterning, and long-form memory.

    Vaeronth, the fifth moon, displayed erratic emission and could not be  
    consistently resolved. Its presence was considered essential to  
    mnemonic structure and arcane behavior. Without precursor, Vaeronth  
    lost cohesion and ruptured. The fragments did not disperse into deep  
    orbit. Instead, they formed a dense, stable ring structure along its  
    former trajectory. The ring remains visible and displays intermittent  
    spectral disturbance. Some cultures consider it a fractured echo of the  
    lost moon.

    After Vaeronth’s collapse, Khyrael began to appear.

    It is not a moon. It does not reflect, emit, or block in any  
    conventional sense. It is seen only through distortion: a localized  
    warping of stellar backgrounds and atmospheric lensing. Its form is  
    unresolved, but appears to occupy volume without mass. It drifts at  
    irregular intervals and has no stable orbit. It does not interact with  
    the other moons.

    Khyrael is not classified among celestial bodies. Its presence is  
    associated with loss of pattern and increased environmental noise. Its  
    arrival coincides with the onset of planetary incoherence.

    The loss of Vaeronth marked the end of lunar resonance. Environmental  
    systems lost predictability. Pressure fields collapsed. Permafrost  
    advanced rapidly across midlatitudes. Agricultural timing failed.  
    Settlement patterns destabilized. Populations began to fragment.

    In their final known alignment, the four surviving moons initiated a  
    tectonic containment event. A basin was sealed at fault intersections  
    and isolated by uplifts. Within the sealed valley, environmental  
    coherence was retained. Beyond it, collapse continued.

%%% 02_sealed_valley.txt %%%

NAME  
    sealed_valley - record of the last survivable region

DESCRIPTION  
    After Vaeronth collapsed, the moons fell out of rhythm. Weather  
    systems became unstable. Permafrost spread. Temperatures dropped  
    faster than they could recover. Most of the planet became  
    uninhabitable.

    In their last known alignment, the surviving moons triggered a  
    tectonic shift. A deep valley was sealed by rising ridges.  
    The basin became cut off from the rest of the world.

    The sealed valley is the last region where the environment still  
    works. Heat is retained. Weather repeats. Plants grow. Cycles  
    respond to the seasons. Life continues.

    Outside the valley, collapse is unchecked. Most of the surface is  
    frozen, scorched, or lifeless. Weather is erratic. Signals no  
    longer follow pattern. Time is difficult to track.

    Civilization did not survive. The systems inside the valley held,  
    but language, order, and memory degraded. The cause is not fully  
    understood. The presence of Khyrael continued after the sealing  
    and is believed to have interfered with continuity.

    The valley was sealed by lunar alignment. The remaining moons  
    acted in final resonance to isolate the basin. No further  
    alignment has occurred since.

%%% 03_valley_overview.txt %%%

NAME  
    valley_overview - last habitable terrain following planetary collapse

DESCRIPTION  
    The sealed valley is the only region where life remains viable.  
    It was enclosed by tectonic force during the final lunar alignment.  
    Surrounding ridges were raised outward, forming an impassable  
    mountain boundary. Outside the valley, the world is lost beneath  
    deep permafrost, moving glacier, and atmospheric ruin.

    The interior forms a compact supercontinental basin. Biomes are  
    compressed into narrow transitions. Plains and meadows dominate  
    low elevations. Forest belts rise in layered rings-evergreen,  
    deciduous, and mixed. Small and steep hills are frequent, often  
    leading to river-fed wetlands, swamps, or glacial runoff.

    Thermal energy is maintained by deep geothermal pressure.  
    No solar heat cycle remains strong enough to sustain climate.  
    Volcanic zones are active but unevenly distributed. The land  
    is warm, but fragile. Some vents are exposed. Others sit below  
    lakebeds, swamps, or subsurface stone.

    Glacial presence remains along outer walls and northern bands.  
    Ice migrates in slow pressure waves but does not reach interior  
    systems. Tundra conditions appear near fault scars and rising  
    massifs. Badlands and stripped subsoil zones mark regions of  
    former rupture.

    No working structures survive. Ruins dot the interior in varied  
    states of erosion and overgrowth. Most are anonymous. Some are  
    half-buried or flooded. None are in use.


%%% 04_ruin_structures.txt %%%

NAME  
    ruin_structures - surviving monuments to the celestial order

DESCRIPTION  
    Seven ruin sites remain across the sealed valley. Each corresponds  
    to one of the known celestial bodies: the star Aurenzae, the five  
    moons, and the anomaly Khyrael. These are not natural formations.  
    They were constructed by the ancient elemental races that once  
    inhabited the valley.

    The ruins were monuments - aligned to sky cycles, elemental  
    influence, and orbital rhythm. The ancient people named the  
    celestial bodies and built each structure to honor one of them.  
    These sites were not ceremonial. They were part of a working  
    system that regulated environmental balance through resonance.

    During the final alignment, the monuments were activated. They  
    harnessed the last energy of the moons to seal the valley and  
    raise its mountains. This act drained the celestial system. The  
    collapse followed. Civilization ended. Only the monuments remain.

    The ruins are now dormant. No text, signal, or mechanism survives.  
    Each is partially buried, fractured, or overgrown. They are still  
    structurally aligned - to star angle, seasonal shift, and orbit  
    position - but they do not glow, respond, or move. Their role in  
    the present is not understood.

    Ruin access is limited by distance, cold, and terrain. Most are  
    surrounded by hostile zones or isolated beyond safe travel.  
    Reaching them requires preparation. Interacting with them does  
    not involve puzzles or ritual. Entry is the challenge.

    Each ruin corresponds to:

        Aurenzae   - fault-rooted slant in the southern horizon  
        Taeryniel  - monolithic vault partially collapsed near uplands  
        Irraketh   - broken ring of heat-scored stone in ash field  
        Lovaen     - tilted spire scattered across a ridge fracture  
        Serunel    - basin-carved trench crossed by glacial runoff  
        Vaeronth   - sunken plate obscured by ring debris and silence  
        Khyrael    - distortion zone with no visible architecture

    All other traces of the ancient world have vanished. These ruins  
    are the last structures tied to the celestial order.
%%% 05_shard_behavior.txt %%%

NAME  
    shard_behavior - inert celestial fragments retained by megafauna

DESCRIPTION  
    Shards are small fragments of Vaeronth, the moon associated with  
    structural order and arcane resonance. After Vaeronth collapsed,  
    its remnants dispersed into planetary orbit. Most debris became  
    part of the ring structure that now surrounds Elyden.

    A minority of fragments reached the surface. These pieces are  
    inert, dense, and structurally irregular. They do not emit light,  
    react to stimuli, or show internal energy. No known device has  
    succeeded in altering or replicating a shard.

    Shards are no longer found on open ground. They are now retained  
    exclusively within megafauna - large, rare organisms that have  
    adapted to survive the collapse. A shard is released only when  
    such a creature is killed. No other method of extraction has  
    proven successful.

    When recovered, shards can be bound to a single item: a weapon  
    or a piece of armor. The process does not require tools, heat,  
    or ritual. Contact is sufficient. The item becomes altered.  
    Functionality improves in ways that support survival.

    Shards are consumed on use. They cannot be reused, broken down,  
    or extracted once applied. Each item can receive only one shard.

    The internal structure of shards appears crystalline under  
    magnification, though patterns differ between samples. All  
    share physical properties: weight, hardness, and fracture  
    resistance well beyond native materials. No atmospheric or  
    biological effect has been recorded from exposure.
%%% 06_megafauna.txt %%%

NAME  
    megafauna - surviving apex organisms from pre-collapse ecosystems

DESCRIPTION  
    Megafauna are large, biologically extreme creatures that persist  
    in isolated zones across the valley. They are not magical, mutated,  
    or designed. They are remnants of a time when planetary systems  
    still supported complex, energy-intensive life.

    These organisms existed prior to the collapse. Most lived in  
    marginal biomes-tundra, ash plain, deep forest, fractured slope-  
    and adapted over centuries to worsening conditions. They are rare  
    and do not congregate. Most are solitary. Each territory is large  
    and ecologically distinct.

    Their scale exceeds all other known species. Some are predatory.  
    Others defend territory aggressively. All respond to intrusion  
    with force. Movement is infrequent, often seasonal. Encounters  
    are rare and typically fatal.

    All known shards are recovered from megafauna. Each specimen  
    carries one. The method of retention is not understood.  
    Extraction is only possible after death. No other source  
    yields viable fragments.

    Their appearance evokes a familiar aura of eminence.  
    The effect is consistent, immediate, and not explained.  
    It is never discussed.

%%% biomes/00_biome_index.txt %%%

NAME  
    biome_index - stable terrain zones observed within the sealed valley

DESCRIPTION  
    The valley contains multiple distinct biomes shaped by post-collapse  
    climate patterns and geothermal persistence. Each zone is a response  
    to failed planetary rhythms and residual tectonic heat.

    Biomes do not represent difficulty or progression. Conditions vary  
    locally by elevation, slope, water retention, canopy cover, and  
    seasonal exposure. No region is guaranteed safe or sustainable.

    The biomes below are canon. Additional zones may exist at margins  
    or as transient anomalies.

LIST  

    CORE ZONES  
        Plains             - open, flat terrain with minimal vegetation  
        Meadow             - seasonal lowland with shallow-rooted grasses  
        Hills              - uneven terrain with limited soil retention  
        Mixed Forest       - canopy zone with both evergreen and deciduous species  
        Evergreen Forest   - conifer-dense highland, low light, cold retention  
        Deciduous Forest   - broadleaf forest with seasonal foliage cycles  

    WET AND TRANSITIONAL  
        Swamp              - waterlogged flatland with poor drainage  
        Lake               - static freshwater body, often geothermal-fed  
        Wet Slope          - condensation-fed incline near volcanic bands

    COLD REGIONS  
        Tundra             - frozen subsoil zone with minimal plant structure  
        Glacier            - moving ice mass at elevation margins  
        Ice Shelf          - stable frost layer at outer periphery  
        Frost Sink         - internal basin with permanent permafrost  
        Unclimbable Ridge  - tectonic boundary beyond which no traversal is possible  

    HEAT-STRESSED AND DISTRESSED  
        Volcanic Slope     - vented terrain with geothermal instability  
        Ash Field          - sterile basin exposed to thermal decay and particulate  
        Badlands           - fractured, eroded ground with poor water retention  


%%% biomes/01_plains.txt %%%

NAME  
    plains - open lowland terrain with sparse vegetation and high exposure

DESCRIPTION  
    Plains are flat or gently rolling open regions with minimal elevation  
    change. Vegetation is discontinuous and dominated by hardy grasses,  
    root clusters, and seasonal moss layers. Canopy cover is absent.  
    Soil is shallow, brittle, and prone to wind stripping.

    Plains are subject to temperature volatility due to exposure.  
    Daytime warmth can accumulate briefly under direct light, but  
    ground heat is quickly lost. Wind shear is common. Surface  
    water is rare except during melt or runoff.

    Wildlife is limited to fast-moving grazers, subterranean feeders,  
    and insect swarms during short warm windows. Natural cover is  
    nonexistent. Any travel across plains is visible and unprotected.

    Plains typically appear between basin forests and marginal ridgelines,  
    or as internal corridors linking lowland zones.

ZONE TRAITS  
    - Mobility:       open  
    - Visibility:     clear  
    - Cover:          none  
    - Water Access:   seasonal  
    - Forage Density: low  
    - Threat Level:   low

%%% biomes/02_meadow.txt %%%

NAME  
    meadow - open lowland with seasonal growth and shallow biodiversity

DESCRIPTION  
    Meadows are low-lying open zones with periodic moisture retention  
    and fast-growing surface vegetation. Grasses dominate, supported  
    by scattered herbs and low flowering species during brief bloom  
    periods. Tree growth is suppressed due to thin soil and hydrology.

    Water collects in shallow basins after melt or condensation cycles,  
    but drains quickly. Soil is soft and prone to saturation. Movement  
    is easy when dry but can become unstable during thaw or rainfall.

    Wildlife includes small grazers, foragers, and airborne insect  
    clusters. Predation is low but visibility is compromised by grass  
    height and terrain undulation. Cover is deceptive-low to the ground  
    but enough to obscure movement.

    Meadows occur near flood hollows, lake outlets, or as internal  
    pockets between forest and plain.

ZONE TRAITS  
    - Mobility:       open  
    - Visibility:     intermittent  
    - Cover:          sparse  
    - Water Access:   seasonal  
    - Forage Density: moderate  
    - Threat Level:   low

%%% biomes/03_hills.txt %%%

NAME  
    hills - uneven terrain with low soil stability and limited vegetation

DESCRIPTION  
    Hills are moderate elevation zones defined by irregular slopes,  
    patchy soil retention, and surface instability. Vegetation is  
    mixed and typically sparse, with low shrubs, lichen, and  
    occasional stunted trees on plateaus or shaded slopes.

    Wind exposure is high. Water runoff is rapid. Soil erosion  
    is common on steeper grades, exposing sublayers of rock or  
    fractured sediment. Movement is viable but requires caution  
    on loose gradients or fractured ledges.

    Wildlife tends to follow ridge lines or settle in wind-sheltered  
    depressions. Visibility varies with terrain profile. Sound  
    travels unevenly across slopes. Hills may form natural corridors  
    between enclosed basins or provide access to adjacent ridgelines.

ZONE TRAITS  
    - Mobility:       variable  
    - Visibility:     intermittent  
    - Cover:          sparse  
    - Water Access:   unreliable  
    - Forage Density: low  
    - Threat Level:   moderate

%%% biomes/04_mixed_forest.txt %%%

NAME  
    mixed_forest - transitional canopy zone with interlaced deciduous and evergreen growth

DESCRIPTION  
    Mixed forests occur where coniferous and broadleaf species coexist  
    due to overlapping temperature bands or irregular soil conditions.  
    These zones are structurally dense with layered vegetation, fallen  
    timber, and seasonal undergrowth. Ground visibility is limited.

    The canopy is inconsistent. Light penetration varies by section.  
    Moisture is retained longer than in plains or hills, supporting  
    fungi, mosses, and invertebrate biomass. Noise dampening is high.  
    Movement is possible but slow.

    Fauna density is moderate. Most species rely on cover, ambush  
    behavior, or canopy nesting. Tracks and den signs may be  
    obscured by leaf debris. Navigation without fixed landmarks  
    is unreliable.

    Mixed forests typically form between evergreen slopes and  
    deciduous lowlands, or along soil shifts in geothermal zones.

ZONE TRAITS  
    - Mobility:       obstructed  
    - Visibility:     intermittent  
    - Cover:          dense  
    - Water Access:   moderate  
    - Forage Density: moderate  
    - Threat Level:   variable

%%% biomes/05_evergreen_forest.txt %%%

NAME  
    evergreen_forest - high-canopy coniferous zone with minimal undergrowth

DESCRIPTION  
    Evergreen forests form in colder elevation bands where broadleaf  
    species cannot survive. The canopy is dominated by conifers with  
    needle foliage, high vertical structure, and limited seasonal change.  
    Light penetration is low. Ground vegetation is sparse and patchy.

    Soil is acidic and retains moisture inconsistently. Organic debris  
    accumulates slowly. Underfoot terrain is often dry, rootbound,  
    and uneven. Movement is possible but visibility is reduced in  
    all directions.

    Wildlife is adapted for cold, camouflage, and stillness. Fauna  
    tend toward solitary behavior. Tracks are infrequent. Sounds  
    are muffled. Threat presence is difficult to verify without  
    direct sighting.

    Evergreen zones commonly form above mixed forest lines or along  
    high interior slopes exposed to seasonal frost.

ZONE TRAITS  
    - Mobility:       obstructed  
    - Visibility:     blocked  
    - Cover:          dense  
    - Water Access:   unreliable  
    - Forage Density: low  
    - Threat Level:   high

%%% biomes/06_deciduous_forest.txt %%%

NAME  
    deciduous_forest - seasonal broadleaf canopy with layered undergrowth

DESCRIPTION  
    Deciduous forests are dominated by broadleaf trees that shed foliage  
    cyclically. Canopy cover is variable throughout the year, allowing  
    significant light during bare periods and near-total shadow under  
    full growth. Leaf litter accumulates rapidly, softening ground noise  
    and obscuring surface detail.

    Soil is richer than in coniferous zones, supporting layered growth  
    including shrubs, ferns, and intermittent fungi. Water retention is  
    moderate. Movement is steady but navigation is hindered by visual  
    repetition and obscured terrain contours.

    Wildlife includes nesters, climbers, and patterned ground foragers.  
    Activity levels rise with canopy exposure. Predation is opportunistic.  
    Sound clarity depends on foliage density and time of year.

    Deciduous forests appear in lower elevations, typically downstream  
    from geothermal sources or near transitional meadows.

ZONE TRAITS  
    - Mobility:       moderate  
    - Visibility:     variable  
    - Cover:          moderate  
    - Water Access:   moderate  
    - Forage Density: moderate  
    - Threat Level:   moderate

%%% biomes/07_swamp.txt %%%

NAME  
    swamp - waterlogged lowland with unstable footing and high biomass

DESCRIPTION  
    Swamps are saturated zones where groundwater or runoff collects  
    faster than it drains. Vegetation includes dense reeds, tangled  
    root systems, moss mats, and submerged debris. Tree growth is  
    stunted or irregular. Soil is loose or fully submerged.

    Movement is unpredictable. Surface stability varies with rainfall,  
    melt cycles, and geothermal flow. Visibility is compromised by  
    vegetation and elevation shifts. Standing water supports insect  
    blooms and microbial heat traps.

    Wildlife is opportunistic, amphibious, or semi-buried. Noise levels  
    are high but not reliable for detection. Encounters may occur at  
    close range with little warning. Navigation requires caution and  
    visual memory.

    Swamps typically form near lake margins, blocked hollows, or  
    shallow geothermal gradients with poor slope.

ZONE TRAITS  
    - Mobility:       poor  
    - Visibility:     blocked  
    - Cover:          dense  
    - Water Access:   present  
    - Forage Density: high  
    - Threat Level:   high

%%% biomes/08_lake.txt %%%

NAME  
    lake - static freshwater body with exposed perimeter and unstable margins

DESCRIPTION  
    Lakes form in natural depressions where geothermal melt or rainfall  
    accumulates. Most are isolated, shallow, and irregular in shape.  
    Water clarity varies with depth and sediment content. Shorelines  
    are uneven, shifting between firm banks, saturated soil, and silt  
    shelves prone to collapse.

    Vegetation is minimal along the interior edge but denser at outflow  
    zones. Surrounding ground may freeze seasonally, forming partial ice  
    layers that obscure depth and footing.

    Fauna include water-bound scavengers, submerged foragers, and  
    migratory feeders. Surface stillness masks movement. Visibility  
    is clear in open water but compromised near banks.

    Lakes are uncommon and usually appear at the base of hills, near  
    geothermal pockets, or within sealed depressions.

ZONE TRAITS  
    - Mobility:       obstructed  
    - Visibility:     clear (open) / blocked (shore)  
    - Cover:          none  
    - Water Access:   present  
    - Forage Density: low  
    - Threat Level:   moderate

%%% biomes/09_wet_slope.txt %%%

NAME  
    wet_slope - geothermal incline with persistent moisture and unstable terrain

DESCRIPTION  
    Wet slopes form along inclines where geothermal condensation  
    accumulates without draining. Surface material remains damp  
    year-round. Vegetation is limited to moss layers, root nets,  
    and moisture-tolerant shrubs clinging to angled ground.

    Soil is soft, fractured, and prone to slippage. Rocks loosen  
    under minimal pressure. Mist layers reduce visibility. Movement  
    requires caution and deliberate route selection.

    Wildlife is rare and limited to small burrowers, insects, and  
    ridge-dwelling opportunists. Predators avoid the zone due to  
    noise propagation and poor footing.

    Wet slopes occur near volcanic gradients, steam-fed gullies,  
    or fractured geothermal veins. They often border swamp margins  
    or lead into flood hollows.

ZONE TRAITS  
    - Mobility:       poor  
    - Visibility:     intermittent  
    - Cover:          sparse  
    - Water Access:   present  
    - Forage Density: low  
    - Threat Level:   low

%%% biomes/10_flood_hollow.txt %%%

NAME  
    flood_hollow - low basin with seasonal water saturation and dense vegetation

DESCRIPTION  
    Flood hollows are terrain depressions that collect water during  
    melt or rainfall cycles. Drainage is inconsistent. Pools form  
    in nested basins, intercut by root structures and soft ground.  
    During dry periods, the zone becomes muddy but remains impassable  
    at depth.

    Vegetation is thick and uneven. Growth includes tall grasses,  
    reed systems, and water-adapted brush. Tree density is low but  
    surface clutter is high. Movement is impeded. Slope direction  
    may be unclear due to basin warping.

    Wildlife includes waders, submerged foragers, and short-range  
    ambush species. Visibility is unreliable. Still water masks  
    motion and terrain hazards.

    Flood hollows typically appear between meadow zones and  
    geothermal water discharge paths.

ZONE TRAITS  
    - Mobility:       poor  
    - Visibility:     blocked  
    - Cover:          dense

    - Forage Density: moderate  
    - Threat Level:   moderate

%%% biomes/11_tundra.txt %%%

NAME  
    tundra - cold flatland with frozen subsoil and minimal vegetation

DESCRIPTION  
    Tundra zones are open, wind-exposed regions underlain by  
    permafrost. Soil is shallow and locked for most of the year.  
    Vegetation is limited to mosses, lichens, and small cushion  
    plants. No trees survive. Color and motion are minimal.

    Surface thaw may occur briefly during geothermal surges or  
    seasonal light exposure. Drainage is poor; ice forms shallow  
    crusts above saturated ground. Terrain is flat but uneven  
    due to frost heave.

    Wildlife includes burrowers, cold-adapted grazers, and  
    occasional transient predators. Animal presence is sparse.  
    Visibility is high in clear weather but compromised by  
    snow drift or fog.

    Tundra appears near the glacial edge or in elevation zones  
    where thermal reach is minimal.

ZONE TRAITS  
    - Mobility:       moderate  
    - Visibility:     clear  
    - Cover:          none

NAME  
    glacier - moving ice mass with fractured surfaces and unstable depth

DESCRIPTION  
    Glaciers are dense, slow-moving bodies of compressed ice.  
    They occupy outer elevations where geothermal heat fails to  
    reach. Surfaces are layered, cracked, and reshaped by melt,  
    refreeze, and internal pressure. No vegetation survives.  
    All features appear temporary.

    Travel is hazardous. Surface traction is minimal. Deep  
    fissures are obscured by snow crust or light distortion.  
    Sound is reflected irregularly. Light is diffuse, causing  
    directional disorientation.

    Wildlife is absent except for rare transients crossing  
    between thermal zones. Ice shifts can be silent or  
    catastrophic. No stable shelter exists.

    Glaciers form the outermost barrier between the valley  
    and the uninhabitable regions beyond.

    Short-term survival is possible with thermal gear and planned withdrawal.
    No shelter or sustenance is available.

ZONE TRAITS  
    - Mobility:       impassable  
    - Visibility:     intermittent  
    - Cover:          none  
    - Water Access:   frozen

%%% biomes/13_ice_shelf.txt %%%

NAME  
    ice_shelf - static frost zone with brittle crust and sublayer voids

DESCRIPTION  
    Ice shelves are broad, stable formations of hardened frost.  
    Unlike glaciers, they do not flow or deform under pressure.  
    Surfaces are flat but fragile, often covering hollow zones  
    formed by gas pockets or past melt. Cracks propagate without  
    warning.

    Light is uniform and sound carries far. Depth perception is  
    poor due to whiteout conditions. No vegetation exists.  
    Wind exposure is constant. Snowfall layers are shallow  
    and rarely accumulate.

    Wildlife is nonexistent. Movement across the shelf is possible  
    with caution but offers no concealment or resource. Shelters  
    cannot be built. Any fall or pressure failure is unrecoverable.

    Ice shelves appear at the northern rim or in uplifted  
    interior plateaus beyond geothermal reach.

    Short-term survival is possible with thermal gear and planned withdrawal.
    No shelter or sustenance is available.

%%% biomes/14_frost_sink.txt %%%

NAME  
    frost_sink - enclosed depression with persistent cold and trapped permafrost

DESCRIPTION  
    Frost sinks are internal basins where cold air and runoff settle  
    without circulation. Temperatures remain below freezing year-round.  
    Ground is locked in permafrost. Snow accumulates but does not thaw.  
    Vegetation is absent or fossilized.

    Movement is possible but dangerous. Slopes are brittle and descend  
    into flat zones with unstable ice crusts. Visibility is reduced by  
    shadow and particle reflection. Sound is muted.

    Wildlife avoids these regions. No known burrowers or surface  
    species persist. Structural remnants from pre-collapse periods  
    may be buried beneath snow layers but are inaccessible.

    Frost sinks appear as collapsed hollows within ridgelines or  
    low points in interior glacial spill zones.

%%% biomes/15_unclimbable_ridge.txt %%%

NAME  
    unclimbable_ridge - tectonic wall enclosing the valley’s outer limit

DESCRIPTION  
    The unclimbable ridge is a continuous vertical formation encircling  
    the valley. It was raised during the collapse by deep tectonic shift.  
    Faces are sheer, fractured, and without scalable features. No path  
    leads beyond. No descent has been recorded.

    The ridge blocks all visible horizon. Light behavior changes  
    near the boundary due to angle and particulate drift.  
    Wind speed intensifies along upper slopes and circulates  
    downward into interior basins.

    No vegetation grows. Surface ice forms seasonally on shaded  
    sections. Rockfall is unpredictable. Seismic echoes may  
    persist for minutes after distant impact.

    Wildlife does not approach. No structures, ruins, or  
    thermal activity are found within its band.

%%% biomes/16_volcanic_slope.txt %%%

NAME  
    volcanic_slope - geothermal incline with exposed vents and unstable crust

DESCRIPTION  
    Volcanic slopes are thermally active zones where geothermal pressure  
    reaches the surface. Rock is fractured, blackened, and irregular in  
    shape. Steam vents and minor outgassing occur without fixed pattern.  
    Vegetation is absent. Soil is replaced by brittle ash or fused slag.

    Movement is limited. Crust layers may collapse or shear with heat  
    variation. Visibility is compromised by particulate haze. Chemical  
    residue clings to clothing and equipment.

    Wildlife is absent. No foraging is possible. No structures survive.  
    The terrain resists mapping due to thermal distortion and flux.

    Volcanic slopes appear near valley faults, calderas, or buried  
    geothermal ridges. Ground temperature may exceed survivable limits  
    without warning.

    Short-term survival is possible with thermal gear and planned withdrawal.
    No shelter or sustenance is available.

%%% biomes/17_ash_field.txt %%%

NAME  
    ash_field - sterile flatland with particulate soil and residual heat

DESCRIPTION  
    Ash fields are barren zones coated in fine volcanic residue.  
    The surface is light, unstable, and wind-sensitive. Layers shift  
    with air movement, obscuring depth and any buried terrain.  
    Ground temperature varies by exposure and may retain latent heat  
    from past eruptions.

    No vegetation survives. Soil offers no nutrients or anchoring.  
    Water evaporates or pools briefly before sinking. Movement is  
    physically possible but slow due to footing inconsistency  
    and particulate drag.

    Wildlife avoids ash fields. No tracks are recorded. Pressure  
    changes may trigger minor subsidence. Visibility ranges from  
    clear to fully occluded during wind events.

    Ash fields appear near volcanic slopes, collapse basins, or  
    areas subjected to past thermal venting.

    Short-term survival is possible with thermal gear and planned withdrawal.
    No shelter or sustenance is available.

%%% biomes/18_badlands.txt %%%

NAME  
    badlands - eroded terrain with fractured sediment and unstable elevation

DESCRIPTION  
    Badlands are dry, degraded zones formed by prolonged erosion and  
    runoff. Terrain consists of cracked clay, loose sediment, and  
    exposed strata. Vegetation is nearly absent. Soil structure is  
    discontinuous and collapses under weight or rainfall.

    Elevation shifts rapidly in short distances. Ravines and ridges  
    alternate without pattern. Water does not accumulate. Surface  
    is often dusty, hard-packed, or brittle. Wind exposure is high.  
    Movement is slow and unsteady.

    Wildlife is minimal, limited to scavengers and burrowers.  
    Visual landmarks are few. Ambient noise is carried far.  
    Shelter is rare and unstable.

    Badlands form in failed slopes, fossil basins, or long-term  
    drain zones where nutrients never return.

%%% flora/crafting/01_yew_stavewood.txt %%%

NAME  
    yew_stavewood - dense, flexible wood used for shaping bows and tool cores

DESCRIPTION  
    Yew is a slow-growing conifer with reddish heartwood valued for its strength and  
    elasticity. Its wood carves cleanly and resists cracking under tension, making it  
    ideal for bow construction, hafts, or reinforced bindings. Best harvested in dry,  
    cold conditions when sap content is low. Outer layers are brittle and should be  
    removed to expose the workable inner stave.

    The tree grows in scattered highland margins and forest transition zones.  
    Bark is thin and scaly. Needles are dark and flattened. Mature specimens may  
    yield one or two usable branches per season. Not suited for firewood or fiber.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: primary bow material; shaped, dried, and wrapped for limb stiffness  
    Thea: cut into narrow hafts or spike inserts for close weapon cores  
    Preparation: remove sapwood, split and season for at least one cycle before shaping

%%% flora/crafting/02_spruce_heartwood.txt %%%

NAME  
    spruce_heartwood - straight-grained conifer core used for shafts, frames, and planking

DESCRIPTION  
    Spruce produces a pale, lightweight heartwood with excellent directional strength.  
    It splits cleanly and holds shape under moderate load, making it suitable for arrow shafts,  
    struts, sled runners, and framed structures. It is not as dense as yew, but easier to  
    gather, season, and shape. Should be used dry; fresh-cut spruce may warp or split unevenly.

    Grows in dense, cold-tolerant stands at elevation or northern slope.  
    Bark is scaly and flaking; needles are four-sided and clustered around the branch.  
    Heartwood lies beneath the pale sap layer and should be taken from trunks or large limbs  
    above root flare. Burns poorly and is not suitable as kindling.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: used for arrow shafts or pack frame rails  
    Thea: selected for sledgework or strut reinforcement in field construction  
    Preparation: split from trunk core, strip bark, dry flat or in bundle with airflow

%%% flora/crafting/03_cordgrass_fiber.txt %%%

NAME  
    cordgrass_fiber - long-bladed grass stripped into cordage and binder wrap

DESCRIPTION  
    Cordgrass is a tall, salt-tolerant grass with narrow, fibrous blades.  
    The leaves contain long cellulose strands that can be split and twisted  
    into light cord, wrap ties, or bundle lashings. Fibers are coarse when dry  
    but flexible if soaked. Used for temporary bindings, braidline, or net backing.

    Grows in dense stands along wet margins and brackish inlets.  
    Blades reach waist height, taper to a sharp edge, and remain upright in shallow water.  
    Harvested by cutting at the base and stripping outer sheath. Best used green or soaked  
    before twist. Not suitable for fine textiles or heavy tension.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: stripped for field lashings and binding forage packs  
    Thea: twisted into net loops or trip tension lines in wet terrain

%%% flora/crafting/04_birch_peel.txt %%%

NAME  
    birch_peel - flammable bark sheet used for ignition, insulation, and moisture barrier

DESCRIPTION  
    Birch trees produce thin outer bark that peels in horizontal strips.  
    This bark contains volatile oils that ignite readily, even when wet.  
    Used for firestarting, temporary wrapping, or as a vapor barrier in tool construction.  
    Bark is flexible when fresh, curls and stiffens when dry. Not edible. Not load-bearing.

    Found on mature birch trunks in cool forests and upland slopes.  
    Bark is pale with horizontal lenticels and separates easily in dry air.  
    Best collected from downed trees or natural shedding, not by stripping live trunks.  
    Should be stored flat or rolled to avoid cracking.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: torn into firestarting strips or wrapped around dry tinder  
    Thea: used to line pack interiors or seal moisture-prone trap components

DESCRIPTION  
    Lianas are long, climbing vines that form tough, fibrous outer layers.  
    When stripped and soaked, the bark can be twisted into rope, lashings, or  
    tool grips. The fiber is not load-bearing but holds well under tension.  
    Used for trap construction, bundled wrappings, or temporary fastenings.

    Found in canopy margins and humid forest underlayers.  
    Vines climb tree trunks and sprawl laterally under foliage.  
    Bark is dark, striated, and splits cleanly when scored.  
    Best harvested before drying sets in, then coiled or laid flat.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: twisted into light cord or tied around fletching bundles  
    Thea: braided into snare triggers or wrapped around tool hafts for grip

DESCRIPTION  
    Bulrushes are tall, hollow-stemmed wetland plants with smooth vertical stalks.  
    When dried, the stalks are lightweight, flexible, and easy to bundle.  
    Used for padding in arrow quivers, pack insulation, woven barriers, or mat flooring.  
    Not strong enough for load-bearing construction, but useful as filler or soft-layer backing.

    Found in clusters along lake edges, stagnant shallows, and seasonal flood zones.  
    Stalks grow over a meter tall and terminate in brown or tufted seed heads.  
    Best harvested late in the season when stems are dry and pale.  
    Must be dried upright or flattened under weight to avoid warping.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: layered in quivers or used to line carrying slings

%%% flora/crafting/07_sagebrush_stalk.txt %%%

NAME  
    sagebrush_stalk - brittle shrub stem used for fast ignition and loose tinder

DESCRIPTION  
    Sagebrush is a woody, drought-adapted shrub found across arid and wind-stripped terrain.  
    Its stems dry into hollow, brittle stalks that snap cleanly and ignite rapidly, making  
    them ideal for firestarting or padding tinder bundles. It is not suitable for structure  
    or load-bearing use. Growth is low and branching, with narrow leaves and a pungent scent  
    when disturbed. Found scattered along open slopes or exposed basins.

    Harvested stems burn hot and fast with minimal smoke.  
    Ineffective when damp and should be stored in dry wrap.  
    Adds volume to tinder but offers no sustained heat.  
    Collection is easiest by hand during dry season. 

USAGE  
    Mirriane: bundled as fast-ignition tinder in firestarter kits  
    Thea: burned in surface traps to generate quick smoke bursts  
    Preparation: snap dry stalks at base, remove side shoots, store loosely in dry wrap

%%% flora/crafting/08_mullein_leaf.txt %%%

NAME  
    mullein_leaf - broad, woolly leaf used for wrap insulation and fire-start padding

DESCRIPTION  
    Mullein is a tall, flowering herb with large fuzzy leaves that grow in a basal rosette.  
    The leaf surface is covered in dense trichomes, making it highly absorbent and soft to the touch.  
    When dried, mullein leaves provide lightweight insulation and are useful for wrapping, lining,  
    or as padding in packs and containers. Though flammable, they are more valuable as material  
    than direct fuel. Not edible. Inhalation of smoke is discouraged.

    Found in disturbed soil, exposed slopes, or meadow edge zones.  
    Leaves grow low to the ground in early stages, followed by a tall central flowering spike.  
    Harvest before flowering for best texture. Dry flat to preserve leaf shape and flexibility.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: packed into quivers or wrapped around gear to reduce rattle and absorb moisture  
    Thea: layered inside sling padding or used to line poultice wraps for thermal stability  
    Preparation: gather outer leaves before stalk develops, press and dry away from sunlight, fold gently if stored

%%% flora/crafting/09_pine_pitch.txt %%%

NAME  
    pine_tree - resinous highland conifer used for pitch and fire support

DESCRIPTION  
    Pine is a tall, cold-adapted conifer found in evergreen forests and upper slopes.  
    It produces thick, scaly bark and exudes amber resin at damaged sites. Resin is soft  
    when warm and brittle when cold. Bark can be rendered to extract dense, tar-like pitch  
    suitable for sealing and ignition. Both materials are valuable in survival tasks  
    requiring adhesion, waterproofing, or fire acceleration.

    Resin is scraped from natural seep or shallow cuts and stored cool. Pitch is produced  
    by boiling bark flakes or scorching over fire, then cooled and packed in bark wrap.  
    Collection is safest in dry weather from downed trees or mature specimens.  
    Pine wood is unsuitable for load-bearing use due to warping and splinter risk.  
    Resin and pitch are not interchangeable but derived from the same source.
    
USAGE  
    Mirriane: applied as sealant to arrowheads, shaft joints, and bow wrappings; pitch used to coat fire bundles  
    Thea: mixed resin used in trap adhesives or spark paste; pitch layered on trap surfaces for ignition delay  
    Preparation: scrape resin with bone or bark edge, warm to soften; for pitch, strip bark in flakes, render over fire, and store cool in bark wrap

%%% flora/crafting/10_tamarisk_wand.txt %%%

NAME  
    tamarisk_wand - flexible woody stem used for trap arms and lightweight framing

DESCRIPTION  
    Tamarisk is a shrubby plant found in saline flats and drainage-prone lowlands.  
    It produces long, slender stems that remain springy even when dried, making them  
    ideal for tension arms, light trap triggers, or temporary frame extensions.  
    Bark is thin and peels easily. Wood is not strong but holds shape under light  
    force and rebounds cleanly when bent. Growth is dense and often forms thickets  
    near flood retreats or exposed sediment layers.

    Harvested stems are best taken before full lignification sets in.  
    Older stalks become brittle and prone to snapping.  
    The wood burns poorly and is not used for fuel.  
    Surface grain is smooth; can be shaved or notched without splitting.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: selected for frame extensions or backup shaft cores in emergency repair  
    Thea: used as spring arms or flexible lash anchors in trap constructions  
    Preparation: cut near base, strip bark, dry straight or bind into curve under tension

NAME  
    cattail_rhizome - starchy wetland root with high survival value

DESCRIPTION  
    Cattail rhizomes grow horizontally beneath shallow water in marshes and lake margins.  
    They are thick, fibrous roots rich in starch and edible tissue. When harvested, the  
    rhizomes can be peeled and boiled to produce a dense, nutritious pulp. Drying and  
    grinding yield a coarse meal useful in survival rations. Spoilage is rapid if left  
    wet after harvesting. Best gathered in cool, low-flow water.

    The plant’s above-ground features include tall, spear-like leaves and a dark brown  
    cylindrical flower spike. Rhizomes grow from the base of mature stalks and often  
    run in networks along the mud layer.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: cooked for rations or dried into portable flour

%%% flora/edibles/02_nettles.txt %%%

NAME  
    nettles - iron-rich leafy stalk with stinging hairs

DESCRIPTION  
    Nettles are fast-growing herbaceous plants found along semi-shaded forest margins  
    and moist slopes. They are identified by their serrated leaves and fine stinging  
    hairs which deliver a mild irritant on contact. Once boiled or dried, the stingers  
    are neutralized and the leaves become a nutrient-rich food source high in iron,  
    vitamins, and protein.

    Nettles grow in clusters, often near disturbed soil or water runoff paths.  
    Harvesting is safest with gloves or cloth. Leaves are best taken young and tender.  
    Also usable for tea or dried additive in ration mixes.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: boiled for food; brewed into mineral tea  
    Thea: dried and packed into field poultice layers  
    Preparation: submerge leaves in boiling water for 3–5 minutes; dry flat if storing

%%% flora/edibles/04_bluegrass_seeds.txt %%%

NAME  
    bluegrass_seeds - clustered grass seed used for coarse meal and ration filler

DESCRIPTION  
    Bluegrass is a common wild grass forming dense mats in open terrain.  
    During late-season dry periods, its upper stalks develop compact seed heads  
    that can be stripped and processed into a coarse, low-oil meal. Though not  
    calorie-rich, the seeds offer bulk and can extend limited rations.  
    Most effective when ground and cooked into paste or dry cakes.

    Growth occurs in patches across open meadows and light wood margins.  
    Blades are narrow and deep green. Seed heads emerge upright, branching  
    in narrow fans. Harvesting is done by stripping the upper stalk by hand  
    or blade and separating chaff.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: ground into flatbread or added to broth as filler  
    Thea: mixed into travel paste for sustained low-energy periods  
    Preparation: strip seed heads, dry if needed, winnow to remove husks, crush or grind before use

%%% flora/edibles/07_hazelnuts.txt %%%

NAME  
    hazelnuts - high-fat seasonal nut from deciduous shrub

DESCRIPTION  
    Hazelnuts grow on compact, multi-stemmed shrubs found in forest margins and  
    temperate woodlands. The nuts form inside fibrous outer husks and hard inner shells.  
    When fully ripe, they fall to the ground and can be collected for their high  
    fat and caloric content. Hazelnuts can be eaten raw, roasted, or ground into  
    paste or flour. Their oil content makes them valuable for survival scenarios  
    requiring dense energy with minimal volume.

    The plant has rounded, serrated leaves and produces catkins in early spring.  
    Nuts ripen in late season. Squirrels and foragers often compete for fallen yield.  
    Best collected after husks begin to dry but before shell rot sets in.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: roasted and stored as travel ration; also ground into mash  
    Thea: crushed and added to composite meal blends or bait materials  
    Preparation: remove outer husk, crack shell with tool, dry kernel for storage or roast immediately

%%% flora/edibles/08_firethorn_berry.txt %%%

NAME  
    firethorn_berry - clustered red fruit from thorn-bearing scrub

DESCRIPTION  
    Firethorn is a dense, thorn-covered shrub that produces small red to orange berries  
    in tightly packed clusters. It grows along disturbed slopes, rocky margins, and  
    post-burn zones where undergrowth is sparse. The berries are high in moisture  
    and carbohydrates but mildly irritating when raw. In small quantities, they are  
    safe; larger amounts may cause stomach upset unless cooked or dried.

    Shrubs can grow over two meters in height. Thorns are sharp and rigid,  
    making harvest hazardous without gloves or a stripping cloth. The plant  
    also serves as a natural barrier, often used instinctively by animals  
    for cover or nesting protection.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: harvested carefully and consumed in small amounts for hydration  
    Thea: dried and blended into ration filler or bait paste  
    Preparation: strip berry clusters with cloth or tool to avoid puncture; cook or dry to reduce irritation

%%% flora/edibles/09_rose_hip.txt %%%

NAME  
    rose_hip - vitamin-rich fruit from wild rose shrubs

DESCRIPTION  
    Rose hips are the bulbous seed pods that form after the petals of wild roses fall.  
    They are rich in vitamin C and can be foraged in late season, especially after the first frost.  
    The outer skin is firm and waxy; inside is a pulp containing fine hairs and seeds.  
    Eaten raw in small amounts or boiled into syrup or tea. The hairs are irritating  
    and should be removed if possible. Rose hips are a high-value survival forage  
    where fruiting plants are otherwise scarce.

    The shrub has thorny stems, serrated leaves, and pink to pale white flowers.  
    Found along forest edges, hillsides, and stone breaks. Fruit ripens to deep orange  
    or red and remains attached into early frost periods.

USAGE

NAME  
    alpine_bistort - starchy mountain plant with edible root and shoot

DESCRIPTION  
    Alpine bistort is a short, hardy perennial found in cold alpine and tundra regions.  
    It produces a thick, knotted root rich in starch, and a small pink or white flower  
    spike on a simple upright stem. The root is the primary food source, dug and  
    boiled or dried into meal. Young leaves are edible raw but become tough with age.  
    The plant grows in clusters, often near glacial margins or exposed stone breaks.

    It tolerates frost and poor soil, relying on short growing windows and stored energy.  
    The root can be mistaken for similar plants but has a distinctive pinkish tone  
    and knotty segments. Difficult to harvest in frozen soil, but high in survival value  
    due to its carbohydrate density and cold resilience.

NAME  
    willow_bark - salicylate-rich bark used in poultice treatment for pain and inflammation

DESCRIPTION  
    Willow is a deciduous tree or shrub with long, narrow leaves and flexible branches.  
    The inner bark contains salicin, a natural compound that reduces pain and swelling  
    when applied topically or infused. Stripped bark can be used in field treatments  
    for muscle strain, bruising, and joint stress. Not suitable for internal use without refinement.

    Grows along rivers, lake margins, and lowland plains where water is consistent.  
    Bark is harvested from young branches or twigs, avoiding damage to the trunk.  
    Best gathered in spring or early thaw when sap begins to rise.  
    Tannin content requires bark to be cured or boiled before application.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: used in limb wrappings during cold exposure or after overdraw strain  
    Thea: ground into paste for trapline bruising recovery or shared among wounded followers  
    Preparation: strip bark with bone edge or nail, soak or simmer into pulp, apply warm

NAME  
    yarrow - flowering plant used for clotting and surface wound treatment

DESCRIPTION  
    Yarrow is a perennial herb known for its feathery leaves and dense white or pink flower heads.  
    It grows in dry grasslands, meadows, and disturbed open soil. The leaves contain compounds  
    that promote clotting and have mild antiseptic properties. Crushed fresh, they can be applied  
    directly to cuts and abrasions to slow bleeding and reduce surface infection risk.

    The plant stands 30–60 cm tall with flat-topped inflorescences. Leaves are finely divided  
    and aromatic when crushed. Flowering occurs in late season. It is often overlooked due to  
    its soft appearance but is valued in field dressing kits.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: leaves crushed and applied directly to cuts  
    Thea: dried and folded into wound pack layers or ground into poultice binder  
    Preparation: harvest flowering tops and upper leaves, use fresh or dry in shade for storage

NAME  
    frost_spurge - cold-zone plant with caustic sap used to sterilize wounds

DESCRIPTION  
    Frost spurge is a low, sprawling plant with narrow needle-like leaves and pale stems.  
    It thrives in nutrient-poor, wind-exposed permafrost terrain. When cut, the plant  
    releases a milky white sap that is chemically irritating. Applied carefully, this sap  
    can be used to sterilize small wounds or kill surface parasites. Overuse causes skin damage.  
    Gloves or cloth are recommended when harvesting.

    Spurge forms dense mats close to the ground. Its stem tips often redden in late season.  
    Animals avoid it, and it rarely grows near forageable flora. Active compounds remain  
    stable in dry or frozen form.

USAGE  
    Mirriane: sap applied to thorn wounds or to sterilize knife edges  
    Thea: used sparingly in blade coating or on trap barbs to prevent rot
