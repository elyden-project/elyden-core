NAME  
    collapse − the moment the known world failed

DESCRIPTION  
    the collapse was not one event. it was the unraveling of all events.  
    structure failed. not buildings or cities, but memory, language, and  
    cause. vaeronth, the moon of magic, ceased its rise. it shattered.  
    its fall was not loud. no fire. no impact. just silence and the  
    long forgetting.

    what remains is not ruin. it is drift. systems decayed. rituals  
    failed. stone turned to dust between uses. machines stopped  
    understanding themselves.

    no one remembers what the world was. only that it isn't this.

NOTES  
    fragments of vaeronth can be found across the land. they do not glow.  
    they do not cast spells. they interfere − with heat, sound, intent.  
    some can be bound. most cannot.

    no one survived by resisting the collapse. only by adapting to it.

%%% 02.txt %%%

NAME  
    sealed valley − the last survivable region in elyden

DESCRIPTION  
    the valley is not a sanctuary. it is a containment. ringed by volcanic  
    ridges cooled into black stone, the valley was sealed in the era  
    following the collapse. not by design. by necessity.

    beyond the ridges is cold without life. a planetary freeze swallowing  
    all landforms beyond the thermal boundary. even light bends differently  
    past the barrier.

    within, ecosystems persist under strain. the land does not heal. it  
    mutates. seasons do not follow sequence. weather systems overlap.  
    terrain folds into itself.

    there are no settlements. no functioning roads. nothing is named.

    the seal does not protect. it isolates.

NOTES  
    most assume the valley is artificial. no records confirm this.  
    steam fissures, geothermal lakes, and shard storms suggest irregular  
    tectonic events continue. some are survivable. others erase terrain  
    outright.

    nothing has entered from outside in living memory. nothing has left.

%%% 03.txt %%%

NAME  
    celestial bodies − aurenzae and the moons of elyden

DESCRIPTION  
    six moons orbit elyden, and one quiet star rises above them.  
    once, their cycles held meaning—tides, seasons, memory.  
    now, their orbits drift. no calendars remain. no names  
    are spoken aloud. but their effects are felt. always.

    the moons do not punish. they shift. they bend life into  
    new shapes. anyone who survives long enough learns to feel  
    when one is near.

    nothing in the sky offers prophecy. only rhythm.

AURENZAE − sun  
    red and quiet. warms the valley just enough to hold breath  
    through long winters. on clear days, it hums low. on others,  
    it flickers and vanishes for hours. not feared. not trusted.  
    but welcome, when seen.

TAERYNIEL − earth moon  
    brings weight to stone and sap. tools sit heavier.  
    roots thicken. sleeping near stone is deeper, harder.  
    fissures widen. caves breathe slow.

IRRAKETH − fire moon  
    lights vents and sparks hidden tinder. wounds close faster  
    but fever comes quicker. insects rise. forgework, when it  
    exists, happens here.

LOVAEN − air moon  
    shifts the wind’s edge. carries scents far, or nowhere.  
    speech feels thinner. songs stretch longer. birds follow it.  
    if they disappear, it has passed.

SERUNEL − water moon  
    makes mist thicken and wells rise. skin softens.  
    rain lingers in the throat. things long buried surface  
    in riverbeds. sometimes they breathe.

VAERONTH − magic moon  
    no longer whole. once shaped memory and logic. now broken.  
    its fragments fall cold. they do not glow. they interfere  
    with purpose. still, some say they can be bound.

KHYRAEL − unknown satellite  
    was never named in the old cycle. dim and still.  
    things slow under it. sprouting halts. sound becomes  
    close. animals turn the wrong way. it does not move fast,  
    but it always returns.

NOTES  
    when two moons align, weather may shift. when three cross,  
    instincts fail. four or more: expect silence, or bloom.  
    none of this is written down. it’s learned by living long.

%%% 04.txt %%%

NAME  
    fragments − cold remnants of the broken moon

DESCRIPTION  
    fragments are found scattered across elyden.  
    most are discarded. picked up, turned over, dropped.  
    they do not respond to touch. they do not react to fire.  
    they resemble glass-struck metal or twisted ceramic,  
    but match no known alloy.

    their origin is not recorded. some assume they fell  
    during the first silence, after vaeronth cracked.  
    others believe they surface from deep shifts.  
    few carry more than one.

    they do not glow. they do not respond to each other.  
    if kept together, nothing happens. if broken,  
    they resist all tools. some shatter under stress,  
    but the result is dust, not insight.

    no tool can read them. no animal reacts to them.  
    no pattern is visible on their surface.  
    only the girls’ amulets seem to sense them.  
    the feeling is brief—pressure behind the sternum,  
    or a short pulse of cold in the jaw.

BEHAVIOR  
    • do not corrode, even in rot  
    • always cold, regardless of environment  
    • retain structural tension — drop sharply, bounce little  
    • resist being lost — fall near body if dropped at death  
    • sometimes found embedded in apex lifeforms  
    • never duplicate — no two are alike

NOTES  
    fragments cannot be forged, shaped, or slotted.  
    not at first. only through contact with specific ruins,  
    and under certain world states, do they begin to respond.

    most die with no idea what they carried.

NAME
    Biomes — terrain classifications and environmental behavior

DESCRIPTION
    Biomes in Elyden define terrain behavior, not political boundaries.
    Each has distinct light, material access, movement difficulty, and survival traits.
    Biomes may shift subtly over time due to terrain instability, elemental cycles, or ecological pulses.

BIOME  
    plains

TERRAIN  
    Mostly flat with gentle slopes. Open skies and strong winds.  
    Soil is dry and gritty, mixed with patches of hard clay.  
    Surface heats quickly in daylight and cools fast at night.  
    Occasional shallow streambeds cut across the ground but rarely hold water.  
    Visibility is excellent, but cover is nearly nonexistent.

INORGANIC RESOURCES  
    • Gravel and coarse sand − useful for fire pits and drainage  
    • Flint pieces − can be shaped into cutting tools (rare)  
    • Clay pockets − usable for crude pottery or sealing gaps  
    • Iron-stained stones − may mark ancient runoff areas  
    • Windblown dust − fine, irritating, clogs gear and eyes

FLORA  

    GRASSES  
    • Little bluestem − tough grass for bedding, insulation, and thatch  
    • Needlegrass − sharp-tipped blades, avoided by grazers

    SHRUBS & SUCCULENTS  
    • Prickly pear cactus − edible pads and fruit, water-storing  
    • Rabbitbrush − yellow-flowered bush, good kindling when dry

    HERBS & LOW PLANTS  
    • Plantain leaf − grows in damp dips; used to soothe insect bites  
    • Wild sage − fragrant and bitter; burned to keep bugs away  
    • Yarrow − feathery plant used for wound care (found near runoff)

    FUNGI  
    • None in open plains. Conditions too dry.

    TREES  
    • None present. Only wind-stunted brush near deeper soils.

FAUNA  

    INSECTS  
    • Field crickets − active at night; edible if roasted  
    • Harvester ants − aggressive defenders of sandy nests  
    • Grasshoppers − jumpy, edible, often seen in warm seasons

    REPTILES  
    • Horned lizards − slow, spiky; eat ants; safe to handle  
    • Gopher snakes − non-venomous, keep rodent numbers low

    BIRDS  
    • Meadowlark − ground nester, calls travel far  
    • Red-tailed hawk − circles for hours, drops fast when hunting

    MAMMALS  
    • Jackrabbit − fast runner; lean meat; hides useful for wrapping  
    • Coyote − curious scavenger; rarely dangerous alone

    SIGNS OF LARGER LIFE  
    • No current megafauna. Scattered old bones suggest past grazers.  
    • Bird migrations pass overhead but rarely stop.

NOTES  
    Plains are easy to walk but hard to live in.  
    No shade, little water, few hiding spots.  
    Useful mostly for travel and spotting weather ahead.

%%% 07.txt %%%

BIOME  
    small hills

TERRAIN  
    Gently rising terrain with soft slopes and shallow valleys.  
    Ground is uneven but walkable. Soil is loamy in dips, drier  
    on crests. Wind slows between hills, collecting leaf litter  
    and debris in folds. Drainage is better than plains—some areas  
    hold moisture longer. Stones are more frequent here, especially  
    near exposed roots or erosion channels.

INORGANIC RESOURCES  
    • Smooth stones − usable for pounding, sharpening edges  
    • Exposed flint − more common than plains; good for toolcraft  
    • Red clay − found in low points; dries hard, useful for lining  
    • Soft limestone chunks − breakable for chalk or filtration  
    • Sand pockets − gather in wind hollows, poor for anchoring

FLORA  

    GRASSES  
    • Big bluestem − tall, tough grass; good for roof thatch or fire  
    • Ryegrass − green into late season; grazed by wildlife

    SHRUBS & SUCCULENTS  
    • Wild rose − thorny bush with edible hips; dense cover for birds  
    • Juniper − low-branch evergreen shrub; wood burns slowly  
    • Gooseberry − thorny; tart berries edible if ripe

    HERBS & LOW PLANTS  
    • Stinging nettle − painful to touch raw; edible when boiled  
    • Mugwort − bitter herb; used for stomach aches  
    • Burdock − large leaves; edible roots if roasted

    FUNGI  
    • Puffballs − round, white fungi found near decaying roots  
    • Dryad’s saddle − shelf fungus on fallen logs; edible when young

    TREES  
    • Scrub oak − short, twisted; acorns must be leached  
    • Hawthorn − small fruit-bearing tree; thorns dense  
    • Black locust − hard wood; burns hot, dangerous thorns

FAUNA  

    INSECTS  
    • Wood ants − build low mounds; sting when disturbed  
    • Dung beetles − common near animal trails  
    • Solitary bees − nest in dry banks; non-aggressive

    REPTILES & AMPHIBIANS  
    • Fence lizard − warms on rocks; insectivore  
    • Toads − appear after rain; eat gnats and small beetles

    BIRDS  
    • Quail − ground forager; coveys scatter loudly when startled  
    • Woodpecker − nests in old trunks; sound echoes over hills  
    • Kestrel − small falcon; hovers before diving

    MAMMALS  
    • Ground squirrel − tunnels beneath bushes; stores seeds  
    • Cottontail rabbit − common; hide and bones useful  
    • Fox − light-footed; hunts small game; cautious of fire

    SIGNS OF LARGER LIFE  
    • Deer trails − worn tracks at tree edges; scat near berry patches  
    • No known predators larger than fox reside full-time

NOTES  
    Hills offer more cover and plant life than plains.  
    Easier to trap small animals. Watch erosion cuts after rain.  
    Stones can shift underfoot when dry. Good place to camp if dry.

%%% 08.txt %%%

BIOME  
    steep hills

TERRAIN  
    Sharp inclines with narrow ridges and uneven footing.  
    Slopes are rocky and dry; loose gravel common.  
    Soil is shallow or absent—roots often grip exposed stone.  
    Water runs off quickly, carving gullies and mini ravines.  
    Climbing requires care; footing crumbles easily.  
    Wind whistles through gullies, stronger at the crest.

INORGANIC RESOURCES  
    • Shattered slate and shale − thin, sharp-edged; usable for knives  
    • Quartz fragments − found in seams; brittle but reflective  
    • Granite rubble − good for shelter wall bases  
    • Iron oxide veins − red-streaked rock; indicator of deeper deposits  
    • Chalk outcrops − soft but useful for basic marking

FLORA  

    GRASSES  
    • Side-oats grama − sparse, clings to dry soil patches  
    • Wild rye − short, tough; seeds edible when toasted

    SHRUBS & SUCCULENTS  
    • Mountain mahogany − dense and twisted; wood burns hot  
    • Manzanita − smooth red bark; berries edible in small amounts  
    • Rock cress − clings to crevices; roots stabilize stone

    HERBS & LOW PLANTS  
    • Thyme − low and fragrant; antiseptic use  
    • Penstemon − hardy blooms; attracts birds and bees  
    • Woolly lamb’s ear − soft leaves used for wrapping wounds

    FUNGI  
    • Very rare; may appear under shaded ledges after rain  
    • Lichen − mixes with moss on north-facing rock

    TREES  
    • Pinyon pine − short, spreading tree; nuts edible  
    • Rocky mountain juniper − scraggly but persistent; good for smoke  
    • No tall canopies; most trees are twisted and low to avoid wind shear

FAUNA  

    INSECTS  
    • Cliff bees − nest in rock holes; harvest carefully  
    • Stone centipede − fast, hides under slate; not dangerous  
    • Grasshoppers − found on dry grass patches in sun

    REPTILES & AMPHIBIANS  
    • Western fence lizard − heat-tolerant; darting hunter  
    • Garter snake − hunts toads; often near trickle zones

    BIRDS  
    • Rock wren − small bird, nests in crevices  
    • Raven − watches from heights; scavenger and signal  
    • Golden eagle − rarely spotted; hunts rabbits and marmots

    MAMMALS  
    • Marmot − thick-bodied burrower; whistles when alarmed  
    • Mountain cottontail − hides under brush piles  
    • Bobcat − elusive predator; avoids campfire smoke

    SIGNS OF LARGER LIFE  
    • Mountain goat tracks (rare) along high ridges  
    • Cougars pass through occasionally; scat near deer kill sites

NOTES  
    Steep hills are rich in stone, poor in water.  
    Climbing is dangerous, but lookout points are ideal for watching herds  
    or tracking weather. Dry air preserves meat longer.  
    Fires may slip on slopes—build stone windbreaks if camping.

%%% 09.txt %%%

BIOME  
    evergreen forest

TERRAIN  
    Rolling or hilly terrain blanketed by dense conifer trees.  
    Soil is acidic and carpeted with pine needles, limiting undergrowth.  
    Light is filtered and dim even during daylight hours.  
    Ground is springy underfoot but uneven, with fallen logs, roots,  
    and moss-covered rocks. Moisture lingers in shaded pockets.  
    Fire spreads slowly but smokes heavily under canopy.

INORGANIC RESOURCES  
    • Smooth glacial stones − useful for tools or heat sinks  
    • Iron-rich sand − collects in low drainage spots  
    • Decomposing bark layers − absorbent for shelter and lining  
    • Pine resin − sticky, flammable; useful for sealing or torch fuel  
    • Flint nodules (rare) − often buried near tree base

FLORA  

    TREES  
    • Douglas fir − tall, straight; excellent firewood and shelter beams  
    • Lodgepole pine − thinner, straighter trunks; ideal for spears, frames  
    • Western hemlock − drooping tips; bark used for tannin extraction

    SHRUBS  
    • Huckleberry − berries edible in late season  
    • Salal − tough-leaved; berries eaten raw or dried  
    • Oregon grape − thorny leaves; tart berries edible with preparation

    HERBS & LOW PLANTS  
    • Ferns (sword, bracken) − widespread; good for bedding  
    • Bunchberry − small plant with red berries; edible, starchy  
    • Wild mint − aromatic; used in teas or poultice

    FUNGI  
    • Chanterelle − golden; grows near fir roots in damp shade  
    • Turkey tail − shelf fungus on fallen logs; used in decoctions  
    • Fly agaric (poisonous) − red with white spots; avoid  
    • Slippery jack − slimy cap; edible when peeled and cooked

    GRASSES  
    • Sparse; mostly at clearings and trail edges  
    • Bluejoint reedgrass − appears near stream cuts or moist ruts

FAUNA  

    INSECTS  
    • Carpenter ants − burrow into deadwood; common  
    • Mosquitoes − dense near any pooled water  
    • Moths − active at dusk; cluster near camps

    REPTILES & AMPHIBIANS  
    • Rough-skinned newt − slow-moving, toxic skin; do not touch eyes  
    • Northwestern garter snake − non-venomous; small prey hunter  
    • Pacific tree frog − peeps heard even if frogs unseen

    BIRDS  
    • Steller’s jay − loud, alert; seen near camps  
    • Northern flicker − woodpecker variant; insect hunter  
    • Barred owl − quiet glider; roosts in dusk

    MAMMALS  
    • Red squirrel − loud, territorial; caches pine cones  
    • Black-tailed deer − skittish; hide well in underbrush  
    • Black bear − may pass through; mostly foraging, not aggressive

    SIGNS OF LARGER LIFE  
    • Elk tracks − seen near clearings; leave hoof prints in moss  
    • Cougar − extremely rare; droppings near deer kill, deep scratch marks

NOTES  
    Evergreen forests offer shelter, fuel, and forage year-round.  
    Firewood stays dry under canopy, but visibility is low.  
    Echoes carry far. Movement is best along fallen trunks and game trails.  
    Stay alert for deadfall and soft rot beneath moss.

    deep evergreen forest

TERRAIN  
    Dense canopy blocks most sunlight; forest floor remains dim and damp  
    even at midday. Understory is sparse but cluttered with deadfall,  
    decaying stumps, and thick moss. Paths are hard to follow—no landmarks  
    last long. Ground is soft, often spongy or slick with decomposing needles.  
    Visibility drops below ten meters in places. Sounds are muffled.

INORGANIC RESOURCES  
    • Waterlogged stones − rounded and slick; used for heat-retaining beds  
    • Thick moss mats − usable as insulation if dried  
    • Resin clumps − gathered from old bark wounds  
    • Rot-softened logs − break apart for insect harvesting  
    • Rare obsidian flakes − scattered from long-past volcanic trace lines

FLORA  

    TREES  
    • Western red cedar − towering; rot-resistant wood, stringy bark  
    • Sitka spruce − straight-trunked; great for bow staves or fire spindles  
    • Grand fir − dense foliage; fallen branches ideal for shelters

    SHRUBS  
    • Devil’s club − spiny stalks; use gloves; medicinal bark but dangerous  
    • Thimbleberry − soft berries; leaves large and good for wrapping  
    • Elderberry − small tree-like bush; berries must be cooked

    HERBS & LOW PLANTS  
    • Waterleaf − soft-leaved plant; edible but easily bruised  
    • Oxalis − sour clover-like plant; edible in small quantities  
    • Skunk cabbage − waxy and large; avoid eating; used to wrap or insulate

    FUNGI  
    • Angel wing mushrooms − white, fragile; edible but spoil quickly  
    • Bear’s head tooth − hanging white spines; found on stumps; edible  
    • Dead man’s finger − black fungal clumps from rotting wood; not edible  
    • King bolete − thick-capped, heavy; excellent food source when fresh

    GRASSES  
    • Almost none. Grass struggles to survive without sunlight.  
    • Isolated reed-like shoots at clear seepage zones

FAUNA  

    INSECTS  
    • Termites − found inside stumps and fallen logs  
    • Mosquito swarms − heavy near stagnant pools  
    • Fungus gnats − hover above rotting bark and mushrooms

    • Northern alligator lizard − hides beneath fallen bark

    BIRDS  
    • Varied thrush − haunting calls; hard to spot  
    • Pileated woodpecker − large; carves deep holes in dead trunks  
    • Great horned owl − near-silent; apex bird in this zone

    MAMMALS  
    • Shrews − insect-eaters; dart through root mats  
    • Pine marten − tree-climber; curious, sometimes bold  
    • Black bear − more frequent here than lighter forests; digs for grubs  
    • Deer − pass through but rarely bed down

    SIGNS OF LARGER LIFE  
    • Scat from bears, elk, or wolves found at mossy trail breaks  
    • Antler rub marks on saplings from passing bucks

NOTES  
    Deep evergreen forest is quiet and humid.  
    Fires are hard to start unless fuel is gathered from above ground.  
    Animal signs are harder to track due to leaf litter and moss.  
    A good place to forage or hide—but not to travel fast.

BIOME  
    deciduous forest

TERRAIN  
    Broadleaf canopy that shifts with the seasons—lush in spring and  
    summer, bare and open in cold cycles. Forest floor is rich with  
    leaf litter, saplings, and decaying logs. Soil is loamy and soft  
    in most places, holding water briefly before draining.  
    Light varies: bright before leaf-out, dappled during full canopy,  
    and exposed in barren months. Animal paths often form trail networks.

INORGANIC RESOURCES  
    • Smooth stones − for fire rings, basic shaping tools  
    • Loamy topsoil − good for root harvesting and plant growth  
    • Clay seams − found deeper near drybed curves  
    • Deadfall limbs − abundant, dries fast under canopy gaps  
    • Coarse sand − settles along runoff grooves

FLORA  

    TREES  
    • Oak − drops acorns; must be leached before eating  
    • Maple − sap can be tapped in cold season; good for tools  
    • Birch − bark peels for fire-starting; inner cambium edible

    SHRUBS  
    • Bramble vine − thorny, fruit-bearing; grows fast along edges  
    • Nutbush − drops hard-shelled seeds; roasted for food  
    • Witchbranch − flexible twigs; bark used in simple remedies

    HERBS & LOW PLANTS  
    • Wild garlic − pungent bulbs; good raw or cooked

    • Broadwing − patient sky hunter; found near breaks in canopy

    MAMMALS  
    • Gray glider − leaps tree to tree; nests high  
    • Forest deer − cautious, light-hoofed  
    • Masked forager − washes food at stream edge  
    • Burrow fox − uses hollow logs or bramble thickets

    SIGNS OF LARGER LIFE  
    • Claw scoring on bark  
    • Rubbed saplings and hoof prints in damp soil

NOTES  
    This forest yields wide edible variety through the year.  
    Water is more available, firewood abundant, and shelter  
    easier than in dry zones. But noise travels, and leaf cover  
    offers less protection from above.

BIOME  
    deep deciduous forest

TERRAIN  
    Thick, old-growth broadleaf woods where light barely touches  
    the ground in full canopy seasons. Understory is dense with  
    vines, rotting logs, mosses, and layered leaf litter.  
    Air is still and humid; sound is absorbed by the foliage.  
    Paths vanish quickly as fallen leaves, fungus, and rainfall  
    erase any prints. Ground is soft but uneven—fallen trees  
    and sunken hollows hide beneath brush.

INORGANIC RESOURCES  
    • Moist clay − found near shallow stream cuts; usable for sealant  
    • Decayed logs − rich in insects and sponge fungi  
    • Bark mulch − useful for ground padding and smoke fuel  
    • Stone rubble − rare, usually near old root masses  
    • Charcoal remnants − found where lightning struck long ago

FLORA  

    TREES  
    • Beech − smooth bark, bitter nuts; long-lived stands  
    • Elm − wide canopy, drops large leaves; dense wood  
    • Hornbeam − slow-growing, dense-grained; tool-worthy when dry

    SHRUBS  
    • Spicebush − clusters of red berries; aromatic  
    • Viburnum − white flowers, blue fruit; birds feed here  
    • Creeping bramble − thorny ground spreader; shelters small animals

    HERBS & LOW PLANTS  
    • Wood nettle − grows in moist soil; edible when boiled  
    • Jewelweed − sap soothes nettle stings and bites  
    • Bloodroot − red sap; caution: use only externally

    FUNGI  
    • Morel − dark sponge cap; hidden under leaf layers  
    • Artist’s conk − large, woody shelf on dying trees  
    • Brittle gills − break easily; some edible, some not  
    • Earth tongue − slender, black fungi near stumps

    GRASSES  
    • Sparse, mostly at fallen tree gaps  
    • Sedge clumps − found where sunlight reaches ground briefly

FAUNA  

    INSECTS  
    • Millipedes − curl into tight ball; feed on rot  
    • Glow beetles − faint light during damp nights  
    • Ticks and mites − cling to skin and fur in thick undergrowth

    • Droop-beak − probes for grubs under bark

    MAMMALS  
    • Forest mouse − nests in rotting logs  
    • Rust-hare − fur blends with leaves; startles easily  
    • Striped scavenger − digs under logs; raids nests  
    • Hollow bear − denser than elsewhere; drawn by mushroom scent

    SIGNS OF LARGER LIFE  
    • Bear den hollows under fallen trunks  
    • Scattered bones and bird feather clumps at clearing edges  
    • Deep scratch lines across tree trunks — from unknown source

NOTES  
    Deep deciduous woods reward careful foraging.  
    Fire is difficult due to moisture—resin or bark kindling needed.  
    Mist lingers through most mornings. Navigation unreliable  
    without clear sun or a return marker. Good for hiding.

BIOME  
    forest (mixed)

TERRAIN  
    Transitional woodland blending deciduous and evergreen growth.  
    Floor is uneven but walkable, scattered with cones, leaves,  
    and fallen branches. Moisture levels shift by zone—dry pine  
    patches lead into damp leaf thickets. Light flickers through  
    shifting gaps. Animal trails are common, winding around roots,  
    stumps, and shallow depressions. Air feels cooler than open land.

INORGANIC RESOURCES  
    • Pine resin − sticky, flammable; useful for torches and sealing  
    • Bark slough − curls from fallen logs; good for kindling  
    • Flint stones − rare, more common where rock breaks surface  
    • River pebbles − present near creeks; smooth and workable  
    • Clay nodules − found in runoff gullies under mixed canopy

FLORA  

    TREES  
    • Red maple − leaf changes with seasons; wood good for handles  
    • Spruce − tight-needled; branches used for cover or bedding

    BIRDS  
    • Treefinch − flutters near water; nests in reed clumps  
    • Scrub crow − mimics sounds; may alert other animals  
    • Nest hawk − hunts small rodents from above

    MAMMALS  
    • Chipmunk − chatters loudly; stores food in rock crevices  
    • Hollow fox − lean and quick; fur blends with dappled light  
    • Ring-tail − climbs trees for eggs and fruit; nocturnal

    SIGNS OF LARGER LIFE  
    • Deer prints lead to shared watering dips  
    • Bear hair clings to tree bark near trails  
    • Snapped saplings suggest nighttime passage of heavy creature

NOTES  
    Mixed forests are the most balanced zones for survival.  
    Water, firewood, shelter, and forage all present.  
    Fewer extremes, but also fewer open views—ambush is possible.  
    Game trails and bird calls help track unseen movement.

BIOME  
    river

TERRAIN  
    Freshwater channel winding through soft terrain.  
    Banks vary: steep cuts with exposed roots, or shallow slopes  
    lined with gravel bars and reed beds. Water clarity shifts  
    with weather. Morning mist is common.  
    Flow muffles nearby sound. Edges are unstable and  
    prone to collapse. Driftwood accumulates in curves and eddies.

INORGANIC RESOURCES  
    • Rounded stones − usable for heating, sharpening, or grinding  
    • River clay − thick and slippery; seals gaps and containers  
    • Sand deposits − fine filtering medium

    BIRDS  
    • Kingfisher − fast, colorful; signals fish activity  
    • Heron − long-legged wader; spears frogs and fish  
    • Carrion crow − opportunist; follows camps and kills

    MAMMALS  
    • Otter − playful but bold; may raid traps  
    • Water rat − tunnels in banks; edible but disease-prone  
    • Wild boar − drinks at river’s edge; highly dangerous if startled

SIGNS OF LARGER LIFE  
    • Crushed reeds and deep hoofprints where large animals drink  
    • Torn banks with muddy claw scrapes—sign of nocturnal foraging  
    • Otter slides—flattened paths from water to mud dens  
    • Broken turtle shells or scattered feathers near eddies  
    • Hollow logs with recent gnaw marks

NOTES  
    Rivers provide steady water, fish, and foraging, but come with hazards.  
    Currents shift banks unexpectedly. Tread carefully near soft ground.  
    Morning is ideal for fishing and tracking animals. Watch the treeline.  
    Some animals here are unpredictable and aggressive—boars, horseflies, and pike among them.

BIOME  
    meadow

TERRAIN  
    Open, sunlit grassland bordered by forest or low brush.  
    Ground is mostly level but uneven in places due to animal trails  
    and buried roots. Soil ranges from dry and sandy in the uplands  
    to moist in shaded dips. No permanent water bodies, though  
    morning dew is common. Wind travels freely here. Shade is rare.

INORGANIC RESOURCES  
    • Pebbles and scattered gravel − usable for tool abrasion  
    • Dry soil − holds warmth, poor for digging  
    • Weathered wood − fallen from bordering trees, dry and light  
    • Old ash patches − signs of past fires; may conceal charcoal  
    • Flint shards − occasionally found along exposed roots

FLORA  

    GRASSES  
    • Switchgrass − grows in dense stands; good for bedding and bundles  
    • Needlegrass − stiff blades, avoid for footwear

BIOME  
    swamp

TERRAIN  
    Waterlogged basin with soft, sucking ground and dense vegetation.  
    Surface is uneven—pools, mudflats, root tangles, and sunken hollows.  
    Air is humid, hot, and filled with rot. Smells shift with every step.  
    Insects form clouds. Visibility is poor beyond reed lines or willow walls.  
    Travel is slow; one misstep leads to chest-deep water or sinkholes.

    • Marsh boar − powerful and territorial; wallows in mud pits  
    • Swamp monkey − rare, nimble; throws objects when startled  
    • Bog rat − bloated, aggressive scavenger; carries parasites

SIGNS OF LARGER LIFE  
    • Torn reeds and claw furrows along banks  
    • Floating feathers and torn fur bundles near shallow kills  
    • Mud trails leading into deeper pools—vanish suddenly  
    • Broken limbs high in trees—sign of climbing predator  
    • Bone clusters at dry island mounds

NOTES  
    The swamp is deadly. Every movement risks ambush, sickness, or misstep.  
    But it offers rare plants, high-protein prey, and the only known source  
    of bush weed. Firewood must be scavenged from above ground or imported.  
    Cooking is vital—parasites are common.  
    Visibility is your worst enemy. So is overconfidence.

    • Stick bugs − cling to stalks; nearly invisible  
    • Wasps − nest in ground or shrub hollows  
    • Ticks − heavy presence; cling in low stalk shadows

    REPTILES & AMPHIBIANS  
    • Field snake − blends with dry blades; avoids confrontation  
    • Ditch frog − loud croak at dusk; draws predators  
    • Tortoise − slow-moving; shelter in low dips

    BIRDS  
    • Meadow owl − silent at dusk; nests low  
    • Burrow wren − hides in reed nests  
    • Buzzard − circles in wide arcs; lands near fresh kill

    MAMMALS  
    • Meadow vole − tunnels under root cover  
    • Hare − sprints when flushed; hard to track  
    • Ferret-like scavenger − quick, aggressive; drawn to traps

SIGNS OF LARGER LIFE  
    • Flattened grass rings—resting sites for heavy animals  
    • Torn stalks and clumps of hair at ambush zones  
    • Narrow tunnels pressed into the growth—frequent animal traffic  
    • Fresh scat left near sparse berry patches  
    • Muffled rustles even in still air—movement unseen

NOTES  
    Deep meadows conceal both opportunity and threat.  
    Foraging is strong in season, but visibility is poor and escape routes  
    are few. Predators use grass walls for ambush. Fire is dangerous here  
    if wind rises—burn patterns are unpredictable.

BIOME  
    lake

TERRAIN  
    Wide, still freshwater body nestled in stable terrain.  
    Shorelines range from gently sloped beaches to shallow inlets  
    with smooth pebbles, clay edges, or reed beds.  
    Water is pristine—fresh-smelling, clear, and warmed subtly  
    by geothermal activity beneath the lakebed. Steam rises  
    gently in early morning. Reflections are near-perfect.  
    Air is calm. Nights remain temperate along the edge.

INORGANIC RESOURCES  
    • Rounded stones − ideal for cooking, grinding, and perimeter use  
    • Warm sand − comfortable underfoot, dries quickly for bedding  
    • Clay pockets − found in shallows; usable for vessels and sealing  
    • Obsidian-like flakes − rare; sharp, useful for cutting tools  
    • Clean gravel − filtered by currents; excellent for drainage paths

FLORA  

    AQUATIC PLANTS  
    • Waterweed − flowing and edible; grows near rocks  
    • Lake lily − floats in calm zones; roots edible, pads shade fish  
    • Duck moss − coats logs; soft for insulation, traps insects  
    • Algae (green and threadlike) − fine for compost, not edible

    SHORELINE PLANTS  
    • Duck potato − starchy root; found in shallow mud  
    • Marsh mint − aromatic, insect-repelling  
    • Broad sedge − fibers used in matting or bundles

    TREES (EDGE & NEARSHORE)  
    • Aspen − tall, flexible; leaves rustle with wind shifts  
    • Birch − bark peels in sheets; excellent tinder and wrap  
    • Cottonwood − casts wide shade; down used for stuffing  
    • Alder − roots stabilize shore; bark has medicinal use

    FUNGI  
    • Shelf mushroom − grows from driftwood; check for firmness  
    • Cupped sponge − edible when young; traps moisture  
    • Dew cap − moist-loving; appears on north-facing logs

FAUNA  

    INSECTS  
    • Mayflies − swarm seasonally, edible in bulk  
    • Lake midges − dance over water at dusk; harmless  
    • Water beetles − cling to lily pads; edible but bitter

    FISH  
    • Lake trout − large-bodied, rich in fat  
    • Pike − leaner predator; aggressive when spawning  
    • Perch − numerous; easy to trap in shallows  
    • Eel − thrives near warm vents; strong flavor, excellent protein  
    • Catfish − bottom-dweller; tough skin, thick fillets  
    • Carp − hardy; feed in mud, better smoked or stewed

    AMPHIBIANS & REPTILES  
    • Water snake − non-venomous; swims swiftly  
    • Giant salamander − slow-moving; lives near thermal pools  
    • Snapping turtle − powerful jaw; often buried in silt

    BIRDS  
    • Grebe − graceful diver; nests near reeds  
    • Heron − patient fisher; signals good fish spots  
    • Loon − low call across water; tracks deep shoals  
    • Wood duck − nests in hollows near shore

    MAMMALS  
    • Lake otter − social, agile; may steal fish if camps unguarded  
    • Deer − often approach to drink; signs frequent at dusk  
    • Marsh hare − grazes near shallows, active early morning

SIGNS OF LARGER LIFE  
    • Well-worn game trails leading down to water  
    • Scattered scales and bones where birds feed  
    • Claw scrapes on tree bark along drinking paths  
    • Shallow hoofprints embedded in drying mud  
    • Otter slides leading into coves

NOTES  
    The lake is generous. Its warmth protects against frost,  
    its edges offer building materials, and its waters teem with food.  
    Winds are predictable. Shorelines stay stable across seasons.  
    For any group seeking refuge or permanence,  
    this is a place that holds on to life.

BIOME  
    unclimbable mountains

TERRAIN  
    Towering vertical cliffs with jagged edges, loose shale, and ice-choked crevices.  
    Faces are sheer—no footholds, no ascent. Stone is fractured, sharp, and  
    wind-scoured. Slopes are unstable and prone to rockfall.  
    Mist gathers in ledges at dusk. Sound echoes harshly.  
    No trails, no vegetation past lower outcrops.  
    Nothing here offers shelter. Eyes burn in the dry wind.

INORGANIC RESOURCES  
    • Fractured slate − brittle but sharp; shatters into flakes  
    • Quartz veins − exposed in broken faces; can spark fire  
    • Ice rime − clings to shadowed cracks; melts into clean water  
    • Gravel scree − sharp underfoot, slides dangerously  
    • Iron crusts − rare reddish deposits, not mineable without tools

FLORA  

    MOSS & LICHEN  
    • Rock lichen − forms pale crusts; edible in desperation  
    • Black moss − clings to cold stone; absorbs moisture  
    • Algae stains − appear on wind-sheltered side; not edible

    SHRUBS (LOW SLOPE ONLY)  
    • Alpine willow − stunted and twisted; twigs used for smoke  
    • Rock juniper − dry, hard wood; slow to ignite  
    • Wind-blasted sage − aromatic, sparse; burned for insects

    FUNGI  
    • None survive this altitude

FAUNA  

    INSECTS  
    • Wind beetles − cling to stone; inactive unless disturbed  
    • Ice gnats − cluster in sunbreaks; harmless, irritating  
    • Cliff wasps − rare; build mud nests behind rock flake

    BIRDS  
    • Cliff hawk − nests on high ledges; watches from above  
    • Ice raven − scavenger; seen only in still air  
    • Swift − darts from hidden cracks; vanishes quickly

    MAMMALS  
    • None past lower face  
    • Occasionally: mountain goat sightings below vertical rise

SIGNS OF LARGER LIFE  
    • Bones caught between rocks, likely wind-dragged  
    • Feather drifts and guano beneath bird nests  
    • No claw marks, no tracks—too vertical  
    • Small scrapes in dusted ledges from wind-flung stone

NOTES  
    These mountains do not invite travel.  
    They stand against movement, sound, and shelter.  
    Winds here can flay exposed skin.  
    Nothing climbs, nothing rests.  
    Only birds own this stone.

BIOME  
    ice

TERRAIN  
    Crusted white plains stretching in all directions.  
    The surface cracks under weight, echoing for seconds.  
    Ice here is layered, refrozen, and riddled with hidden air pockets.  
    No natural shelter. Light reflects hard—eyes must be shielded.  
    Wind is constant and scouring. Sound carries unnaturally far.  
    No clear direction. No color. No heat.

INORGANIC RESOURCES  
    • Ice plates − can be broken into blocks for water or signal use  
    • Rime frost − coats exposed ridges; melts instantly when held  
    • Shattered shards − sharp enough to cut  
    • Buried gravel veins − found at exposed melt cracks; rare  
    • Ice dust − powdery, coats gear; clogs joints and gaps

FLORA  

    MOSS & LICHEN

    BIRDS  
    • Ice gull − seen gliding on distant thermals; rarely lands  
    • Snow tern − migratory; only crosses when weather allows

    MAMMALS  
    • None survive here  
    • No evidence of burrows, tracks, or scat

    REPTILES & AMPHIBIANS  
    • Impossible under current climate

    MARINE LIFE  
    • Not present unless at bordering shelf—this is high interior ice

SIGNS OF LARGER LIFE  
    • Wind-scoured prints filled in by drifting frost  
    • Occasional bone fragment embedded in ice—likely ancient  
    • Cracks with ice-burnt hair sealed inside; origin unknown  
    • Melting pits ringed in soot—old, long-abandoned fire marks

NOTES  
    This region holds nothing.  
    No plant, no animal, no warmth.  
    Travel here is dangerous not from what you meet,  
    but from what never meets you.  
    It is not a place for resting—it is a place crossed quickly,  
    or not at all.

BIOME  
    tundra

TERRAIN  
    Windswept plateau with shallow snow, frozen brush, and hidden stone.  
    Ground is uneven—permafrost lies beneath a thin layer of thawed earth.  
    Plant life stays low to the ground, hugging warmth.  
    Sky is wide, sun low, and sound is brittle. Visibility is far-reaching.  
    Snow crunches dry underfoot. Shelter is rare, but life is present—watchful, wary, and adapted.

INORGANIC RESOURCES  
    • Frozen soil − diggable only with heat or patience  
    • Ice crust − brittle, thin sheets; traps air or moisture  
    • Basalt scatter − dark stone holds warmth; useful for firebase  
    • Pebble beds − under thaw margins; mixed with frost-heave debris  
    • Salt crust − in rare patches near melt streams

FLORA  

    MOSS & LICHEN  
    • Caribou moss − dense mat; edible with effort  
    • Beard lichen − hangs from low brush; used as kindling  
    • Stone lichen − scrapes off boulders; meager nutrition

    SHRUBS  
    • Arctic willow − ankle-high; edible shoots in melt season  
    • Dwarf birch − twisted growth; bark used for wrap and fire  
    • Crowberry − dark berries; persists even in frost

    HERBS & LOW PLANTS  
    • Labrador tea − evergreen leaf; steeped for warmth  
    • Wild chive − seasonal; strong odor, grows near meltwater  
    • Bear root − edible with prep; fibrous and bitter  
    • Moss campion − cushions on dry ridges; small but edible

    FUNGI  
    • Brown cap − rare, grows from insulated root pockets  
    • Ice puff − dry and hollow; shatters when touched  
    • Snow mold − clings to melt edges; not edible

FAUNA  

    INSECTS  
    • Snow fleas − springtail insects; jump in black specks  
    • Tundra beetles − cling to moss mats; edible  
    • Midges − brief summer swarms; irritating but useful for bait

    BIRDS  
    • Snowy owl − watches from stone outcrop; silent hunter  
    • Ptarmigan − blends with snow; shelters in drifts  
    • Arctic tern − migratory; nests in low dunes

    MAMMALS  
    • Polar bear − slow but relentless; avoids fire, not scent  
    • Arctic fox − quick, silent; follows kill trails  
    • Tundra hare − white-coated; strong jumper, evasive  
    • Muskox − rare, shaggy; dangerous when cornered  
    • Lemming − burrows under snow crust; common prey

SIGNS OF LARGER LIFE  
    • Tracks in soft snow — frozen mid-stride  
    • Blood spots trailing off over rise — no carcass  
    • Musk scent near warm stone — sign of recent ox rest  
    • Tunnels collapsing under weight — sign of lemming dens  
    • Bird calls ceasing suddenly — predator nearby

NOTES  
    The tundra holds life by its claws.  
    Food is lean but present. Water flows briefly at midday.  
    Fire is your ally—stone and shrub feed it slowly.  
    Dwell too long, and the cold works its way inside.  
    Move deliberately. Watch the horizon. Something else is.

BIOME  
    glacier

TERRAIN  
    Endless, shifting mass of deep blue ice.  
    Surface alternates between smooth crust and jagged crevasse.  
    Walking is treacherous—fissures hidden by snow or fog.  
    Light refracts oddly here. No landmarks. Sound carries far.  
    No scent, no soil, no shelter. Temperatures plunge quickly  
    as elevation increases. The glacier moves beneath your feet,  
    slow and silent.

INORGANIC RESOURCES  
    • Blue ice − dense, heavy; melts slowly for clean water  
    • Crevasse snow − deep and soft; conceals sudden drops  
    • Glacial gravel − compacted between flows; difficult to extract  
    • Ice nodules − crystal-locked; can be chipped for light diffusion  
    • Frost lenses − thin sheets that fracture when stepped on

FLORA  
    • None survive on active ice  
    • No moss, no fungi, no soil substrate

FAUNA  

    INSECTS  
    • None  

    BIRDS  
    • Ice tern − passes overhead, never lands  
    • White gull − circles melt channels; seen from distance

    MAMMALS  
    • None dwell here permanently  
    • Occasional overpass by scavengers or lost herd  
    • No burrows, nests, or scat—only tracks vanish in hours

SIGNS OF LARGER LIFE  
    • Scoured bones at crevasse rim—possibly wind-dragged  
    • Deep scratches in exposed ice walls—size uncertain  
    • Tracklines across untouched snow—end abruptly  
    • Melted circular patches—warmth origin unknown  
    • Long silence, then echo—may not be yours

NOTES  
    The glacier offers no welcome.  
    No food. No fire. No footing.  
    Each creak beneath the ice is a reminder—  
    the world here is not still. It is waiting.

BIOME  
    badlands

TERRAIN  
    Harsh, broken ground of cracked clay, dust chimneys, and sun-baked ridges.  
    Stone spires rise from dried flood channels. Soil is alkaline and brittle.  
    Wind scours everything, creating deep grooves and sediment walls.  
    Color varies from ash gray to scorched red. Little water, less shade.  
    The landscape holds ruin fragments half-buried and half-erased.

INORGANIC RESOURCES  
    • Cracked shale − splinters easily; sharp-edged  
    • Sunstone − flat and reflective; can signal across distances  
    • Dust — hangs in the air, clings to lungs and skin  
    • Baked clay − workable when wetted; can be molded for heat-resistant containers  
    • Bone piles − scattered and bleached; signs of older kills

FLORA  

    SHRUBS  
    • Sagebrush − drought-hardy; strong aroma repels insects  
    • Saltbush − silvery leaves; some edible parts  
    • Thornweed − sharp, gnarled; grows in cracks

    CACTI & SUCCULENTS  
    • Spined melon − holds bitter liquid; pulp mildly hydrating  
    • Needle bloom − barbed spines; flowers steeped for calming effect  
    • Rock fig − clings to shaded clefts; tough and pulpy

    HERBS  
    • Dry mint − grows between sunstone shards; sharp and pungent  
    • Bitterroot − fibrous; used in small doses for digestion

    FUNGI  
    • None survive exposed surface  
    • Possible fungal traces in deep shaded ruin crevices

FAUNA  

    INSECTS  
    • Scavenger beetle − clusters near remains; edible but foul  
    • Dust wasp − nests in dry clay; aggressive if disturbed  
    • Mites − infest sleeping spots; hard to detect

    REPTILES  
    • Dust viper − camouflaged; heat-sensitive strike  
    • Horned lizard − flattens against ground; edible  
    • Sand gecko − emerges only at dusk

    BIRDS  
    • Carrion kite − watches from stone spires; calls infrequently  
    • Cliff shrike − impales prey on thorns  
    • Ground runner − sprints between rocks; difficult to snare

    MAMMALS  
    • Rock hare − agile jumper; shelters in collapsed holes  
    • Sand fox − elusive; tracks fade quickly  
    • Bloat rat − feeds on dry kills; carries fleas and foul smell

SIGNS OF LARGER LIFE  
    • Dragged bone trails beneath rock overhangs  
    • Blood crust along collapsed wash edges  
    • Large claw marks in packed dust—far apart  
    • Dried mud prints—not human, not animal, something else  
    • Scorched patch ringed in fused clay

NOTES  
    The badlands are a graveyard.  
    Time strips everything here to dust, bone, or silence.  
    Shelter is rare, water rarer. Winds uncover as much as they bury.  
    But scavengers thrive, and where they gather—something fed them first.

RUINS & REMNANTS — INDEX

Each ruin listed below reflects not a past people, but a celestial function.  
These structures stand as scars, anchors, or broken mechanisms of planetary balance.  
They are inert, partially buried, and their meaning—like the shards—will not unlock  
until the final sequence.

Symbols beside each denote dominant celestial association.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

☼  Auren Core  
    Tall hollow monoliths aligned to the pulse of Elyden’s red dwarf.  
    Rare light effects at dawn and dusk. Resonates faintly during equinoxes.

🜃  Earthscript Vault  
    Layered tectonic slates carved with pre-seismic glyphs.  
    Found sunken in cracked hills or beneath landslide zones.

🔥  Vulcan Chamber  
    Basalt-ringed vent sealed by fused obsidian.  
    Emits dry heat and soundless tremors. Lichen grows inwardly, not out.

💧  Mist Basin  
    Collapsed concave shrine filled with permanent vapor.  
    Ruin stones collect condensation even during droughts.

🜁  Veil Engine  
    Spiral wind-channel towers tipped with hollow crystals.  
    Emits quiet whistle when crossed by breeze—sound never repeats.

🌙  Spall Halo  
    Floating shard-ring in low gravity breach zone.  
    Fragments from the shattered Magic Moon orbit in slow unison.

☄️  Oblivion Mirror  
    Surface of ice or black stone that reflects stars unseen in Elyden’s sky.  
    Located only on deep glacier faces or high craters.

🝰  Anti-Life Bulb  
    Rooted pod with dead halo bloom. Found only in shadow-zenith regions.  
    Repels growth, sours wind, and draws scavengers without flesh.

🜔  Convergence Array  
    Obsidian lens set in a triangulated valley.  
    Appears inert, but reacts faintly during multi-moon alignments.

┅  Null Step  
    A staircase or ramp that descends into bedrock and terminates in nothing.  
    No walls, no markings, no boundary between architecture and void.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

NOTES  
    Ruins are dormant until conditions beyond survival are met.  
    Some house shard resonance points, but give nothing until end-sequence triggers.  
    All fragment reactions remain amulet-only. No visible energy or changes occur.

%%% 25.txt %%%

RUIN  
    Auren Core

CONSTRUCTION  
    A single vertical monolith between five and nine meters tall,  
    built from red-black fused material not found elsewhere in Elyden.  
    The surface is warm to the touch at midday, cold at dawn.  
    Hollow core tunnels through vertically—narrow, smooth, seamless.  
    Appears to have been quarried and erected post-cataclysm.  
    Surrounding soil is vitrified in a radial starburst pattern.

SURFACE SIGNS  
    • Partial submersion in hardpan or dry basin  
    • No inscriptions, but fluted bands near base catch fine dust  
    • Sunlight angles cause strong flare when viewed from distance  
    • Birds avoid landing on it; no nests or droppings  
    • Ground often completely dry within a three-meter radius

INTERIOR FEATURES  
    • Core is passable by a thin shaft, barely wide enough to reach in  
    • Internal temperature shifts with time of day, not weather  
    • Stone produces no echo when struck—absorbs sound entirely  
    • Dust that enters is never expelled; no wind reaches inside

DANGERS  
    • Exposed position offers no shelter from heat or cold  
    • Lightning strikes in storms favor the monolith with uncanny precision  
    • Wildlife activity is absent in a wide perimeter  
    • Standing too long within the flare shadow induces nausea or vertigo  
    • Stone chips cannot be broken off—tools fracture first

FRAGMENT INTERACTION  
    The girl's amulet vibrates faintly when within arm’s reach of the shaft.  
    No light, no pull, no heat—only a subtle pressure in the chest.  
    Prolonged contact makes the amulet hum against the skin  
    and then stop, as if holding breath.

NOTES  
    The Auren Core predates speech, settlement, or survival.  
    It does not offer warmth, nor deny it. It remains.  
    The red sun moves across its face in a strict path—never shadowed.  
    Some say five more cores exist, but none have been mapped.  
    It does not respond to prayer, only presence.

RUIN  
    Earthscript Vault

CONSTRUCTION  
    A shallow underlayer of stratified shale and compacted stone,  
    exposed in eroded hillsides, dry gullies, or tectonic shears.  
    Glyphs—neither written nor pictorial—are pressed into layered seams,  
    running parallel with the grain of the stone. Each glyph covers  
    several meters and repeats across faultlines, not surfaces.  
    Stone between glyphs crumbles under pressure, but the glyphs endure.

SURFACE SIGNS  
    • Exposed walls show clean horizontal slices, unusually regular  
    • Stone is dry but emits deep knocks when struck  
    • Debris slopes down unnaturally—like soil avoids covering it  
    • No plant roots penetrate the glyph-bearing layer  
    • Dust patterns settle in concentric ripples on approach

INTERIOR FEATURES  
    • Vaults extend sideways—not inward—into the surrounding strata  
    • Narrow shelves open between compression folds; some hollow, some sealed  
    • Moisture collects in untouched pockets, never leaks downward  
    • Shelves emit deep hum when walked beside during moon tremors

DANGERS  
    • Faults near glyphs are unstable—slabs may shear off unpredictably  
    • Certain exposed glyphs spark nausea or nosebleeds when stood beside  
    • Audible rumble may precede stone fracture but not always  
    • Fine stone dust in air can clog throat, eyes, tools  
    • Burrowing insects avoid the site—except for thin white larvae

FRAGMENT INTERACTION  
    Amulet pulses when close to glyphs—aligned with the stone’s grain.  
    Contact with finger and amulet held to surface produces low pressure hum.  
    No visible reaction, no heat or glow—only the sense of being watched from beneath.

NOTES  
    The Vault was not carved—it was laid.  
    Each glyph is part of a buried array, possibly planetary in scale.  
    Some say it maps the land’s future collapse, not its past.  
    No one remembers building it. The soil forgot—but the stone did not.

RUIN  
    Vulcan Chamber

CONSTRUCTION  
    A collapsed caldera sealed by black fused basalt,  
    forming a ring-shaped depression with vented cracks at its edges.  
    Central structure is indiscernible—sunken and slagged—  
    but rim patterns suggest an engineered form melted beyond recognition.  
    Surface retains residual warmth in all seasons.  
    Outer crust shifts imperceptibly, producing hairline fractures.

SURFACE SIGNS  
    • Stone radiates dry heat even during cold spells  
    • Air above shimmer-fluctuates, distorting vertical vision  
    • Ground is bare; no plants, no dust, no tracks—only scorched rock  
    • Insects won’t cross the rim—neither do birds fly overhead  
    • Sulfurous scent lingers strongest just before sundown

INTERIOR FEATURES  
    • Entry only possible through narrow crawl-like splits in rim  
    • Inside, stone walls are rounded and smooth—liquefied then re-fused  
    • Heat vents exhale silent drafts; air does not rise uniformly  
    • Small objects placed inside vanish within hours—not burned, just gone  
    • Faint red rings appear in vision after prolonged time inside

DANGERS  
    • Chamber holds no oxygen during midday—suffocation risk  
    • Touching central stone causes fingertip numbness, no burn  
    • Flash heat surges sometimes triggered by seismic ripple  
    • Wildlife carcasses nearby show no wounds—just desiccation  
    • Once entered, directionality and balance may distort

FRAGMENT INTERACTION  
    The amulet becomes hot when lowered toward the center ring,  
    but returns to normal if withdrawn—no damage, no discharge.  
    A low droning sound begins only when the wearer turns their back,  
    and stops when faced forward again.

NOTES  
    The Vulcan Chamber is not volcanic. It is an echo.  
    Something burned itself shut here—not to keep you out,  
    but to keep itself in. The heat that remains does not rise.  
    It waits. It remembers what fire used to be.

CONSTRUCTION  
    A concave depression ringed by fractured ceramic tiles,  
    many of which are warped, melted, or partially buried.  
    The basin holds a shallow pool of cold vapor that never disperses.  
    Beneath the mist, stone paths vanish and reappear depending on the light.  
    Rimstones are grooved with narrow runnels that collect condensation  
    regardless of weather or humidity.

SURFACE SIGNS  
    • Basin is always damp—footprints leave no mark in the vapor  
    • Surrounding plants grow inwardly bent, leaning toward the center  
    • Vapor carries no scent, yet numbs the sinuses  
    • Stones around the edge ring lightly when tapped  
    • No birds, no insects—only the sound of slow dripping

INTERIOR FEATURES  
    • Mist thickens the deeper one steps—vision ends after five paces  
    • Ground disappears underfoot—replaced by tiled channels or cold water  
    • Sound is absorbed; speech becomes muffled and directionless  
    • Occasional glimpses of submerged features—domes, stairs, bent poles  
    • Water collected here is sterile, but bitter

DANGERS  
    • Prolonged exposure causes mild disorientation and cold paralysis  
    • Falling in produces no splash—just silence and sudden darkness  
    • Breathing vapor for too long suppresses taste and scent for hours  
    • Some exits lead nowhere—returning takes longer than entering  
    • No wildlife is seen—but eyes are often felt

FRAGMENT INTERACTION  
    The amulet dims slightly within the mist—its edges lose sharpness.  
    Held above the surface, the mist swirls around it in reverse spirals.  
    Afterward, a faint residual moisture lingers on skin for hours.

NOTES  
    This is not a ruin. It is a boundary.  
    Between breath and silence. Between steps and stillness.  
    The basin does not fill, yet it never empties.  
    The vapor tastes of endings.

RUIN  
    Veil Engine

CONSTRUCTION  
    A cluster of thin, tapering spires arranged in a spiral or partial arc,  
    built from white-gold alloy and porous stone.  
    Each spire has a hollow core—cut with ridged inlets that capture wind.  
    Some lean sharply, others stand upright, yet none have toppled.  
    Their tips fracture light, casting broken halos even in still air.

SURFACE SIGNS  
    • Wind shifts when walking near—changes pitch and direction  
    • Surrounding vegetation forms irregular spiral growth patterns  
    • Dust trails curve as if caught in invisible gyres  
    • Stone at base hums faintly if leaned upon during gusts  
    • Wildlife scat absent; no nesting or droppings within 30 paces

INTERIOR FEATURES  
    • Hollow channels draw in wind—even when ambient air is calm  
    • Entering the center of the spiral deadens all ambient sound  
    • Small objects left inside are often relocated without visible cause  
    • Listening into a spire returns fragmented echoes—not your own voice  
    • Stone residue collects at base—powdery and pale

DANGERS  
    • Sudden gusts may knock down the unbalanced or unwary  
    • Prolonged time in the spiral center may induce vertigo or dream flashes  
    • Gusts can strip warmth faster than expected—frostbite risk  
    • Broken spire tips fall silently and without warning  
    • In high wind, resonance can cause headaches, nosebleeds

FRAGMENT INTERACTION  
    Amulet hums in high frequency when wind enters from opposite direction.  
    Held near an inlet, its sound amplifies faintly—feedback loop impossible to record.  
    After leaving, wearer sometimes experiences distorted memory of direction traveled.

NOTES  
    The Veil Engine does not store wind.  
    It remembers the passage of air and returns it fractured.  
    This is where the Air Moon once whispered commands to the ground.  
    Now only half the message remains.

RUIN  
    Spall Halo

CONSTRUCTION  
    A low-gravity anomaly where debris from the shattered Magic Moon  
    continues to orbit above a fixed point—irregularly spaced, silently rotating.  
    Fragments vary in size from fist-sized shards to house-sized slabs.  
    None cast shadows; they emit no heat and bear no markings.  
    Below, a wide ring of scorched earth curves outward—barren and bone-dry.

SURFACE SIGNS  
    • The sky appears slightly warped when viewed directly overhead  
    • Sound dulls noticeably when stepping beneath the orbital path  
    • Birds veer away long before reaching the outer ring  
    • Dust never settles within the circle—wind patterns fail entirely  
    • Ground temperature fluctuates by season, but not by time of day

INTERIOR FEATURES  
    • No entry structure—the Halo is open to the sky  
    • Some fragments shift position without visible force  
    • Gravity changes subtly near each shard—enough to alter walking pace  
    • Voices echo differently inside the ring—delayed, layered  
    • No visible connection exists between the floating shards

DANGERS  
    • Standing under larger fragments for long periods induces vertigo  
    • Sudden fragment descent has occurred—documented once, unrepeated  
    • Amulets pulse erratically, sometimes faint, sometimes painful  
    • Minor equipment malfunctions: compasses fail, tools seize briefly  
    • Eyes may water or feel dried when looking directly at the fragments

FRAGMENT INTERACTION  
    Amulet emits a steady pulse when aligned beneath a specific shard.  
    Stepping out of alignment ceases all sensation.  
    No energy discharge, no light—just rhythm.  
    If left inside the ring alone, some report hearing static “behind the skull.”

NOTES  
    The Halo is not a ruin. It is an orbit that forgot its center.  
    Shards remember their shape, but not their purpose.  
    They float, not by power, but by consequence.  
    This is what happens when a moon breaks—not shatters—but weeps.

RUIN  
    Oblivion Mirror

CONSTRUCTION  
    A flat disc of black stone or frozen water, perfectly circular,  
    embedded at surface level into glacier, tundra shelf, or high-altitude crater.  
    Diameter varies between 3 to 9 meters. Surface appears reflective,  
    but shows no clouds, trees, or living forms—only stars.  
    Stars do not match Elyden’s sky. They do not move.

SURFACE SIGNS  
    • Area surrounding the mirror is quiet—snow muffles too much  
    • Ice crust around edge remains smooth, never cracked or stepped upon  
    • No animal prints cross the perimeter, even in deep snow  
    • Approaching the mirror causes skin to prickle, regardless of cold  
    • Reflected sky is always night, even at noon

INTERIOR FEATURES  
    • No structure—only the disc  
    • Throwing objects onto surface results in dull, soundless landing  
    • Items left atop vanish by next dusk, without trace  
    • Mirror sometimes “blinks”—a brief black-out and return  
    • Reflected stars shift slightly every new moon

DANGERS  
    • Staring too long induces visual noise or false movement  
    • Some travelers report a voice—not heard, but recalled  
    • On rare occasions, people reflected do not match current posture  
    • Entering the disc’s center barefoot causes frostbite in seconds  
    • No sound emitted from within 2 meters registers to those outside

FRAGMENT INTERACTION  
    Amulet freezes instantly when lowered to surface—frost forms on chain.  
    Holding it over the reflection causes star points to slowly drift  
    and form patterns not visible in any recorded sky chart.  
    Pattern fades once amulet is moved.

NOTES  
    The mirror is not broken. It simply no longer reflects us.  
    This is not the past or the future, but the absence of presence.  
    The stars it shows may be our own, seen from elsewhere—  
    or someone else's, seen from here.

RUIN  
    Anti-Life Bulb

CONSTRUCTION  
    A semi-spherical mass rooted deep in barren ground,  
    resembling petrified wood or fossilized resin.  
    Its surface is dull, yellowed, and striated—no two bulbs alike.  
    The structure leans slightly, as if drawn toward the sky’s zenith.  
    A narrow slit runs down its face, but does not open.  
    Ground surrounding the bulb remains sterile even after rain.

SURFACE SIGNS  
    • Soil cracks into fine networks, devoid of worms or root systems  
    • Wind dies at the edge of its clearing, as if held outside  
    • Faint odor of burnt meat or rot—undetectable to some  
    • Fungi and moss avoid even shaded edges  
    • Scavengers circle nearby but never approach

INTERIOR FEATURES  
    • No entry possible—slit is sealed, edges fused  
    • Nighttime presence triggers subtle sound: not breathing, not grinding  
    • Stone near the base is brittle; breaks into scentless black powder  
    • Sometimes a slow throb passes through the bulb—visible in snowfall drift  
    • Touching the surface causes a sharp pressure in teeth and jaw

DANGERS  
    • Animals brought near fall ill within hours  
    • Standing within the radius too long may induce nosebleed or nausea  
    • Sharp changes in mood reported by multiple travelers near bulb  
    • Fire refuses to catch nearby—dies instantly or gutters to smoke  
    • Fragments placed here do not react, but cease pulsing for days

FRAGMENT INTERACTION  
    The amulet grows noticeably cold, pulling gently toward the slit.  
    Contact induces a dull ache that vanishes when withdrawn.  
    No pulse, no glow—only absence.  
    After leaving, the amulet takes longer to react elsewhere.

NOTES  
    This is not decay. It is something older than death.  
    The bulb does not want. It does not think.  
    It silences what lives—not with malice, but with weight.  
    It is the shadow cast by the sun when no moon remains.

RUIN  
    Convergence Array

CONSTRUCTION  
    A wide, shallow valley containing three obsidian lenses,  
    each embedded into a distinct rise—forming a perfect equilateral triangle.  
    Lenses are half-buried, mirror-black, and nearly frictionless.  
    No markings, no frame. Beneath each lies a hollow chamber,  
    inaccessible except through seismic collapse.  
    The soil between them carries no seed, no track, no echo.

SURFACE SIGNS  
    • Approaching one lens triggers headaches or a sudden chill  
    • Birds appear to fly around the array in wide arcs, never over  
    • Wind swirls unpredictably when standing between two lenses  
    • Sound inside the triangle is often mislocalized—origin unclear  
    • Small stones sometimes roll uphill when placed near center

INTERIOR FEATURES  
    • Lenses cannot be moved, etched, or blackened  
    • Occasionally reflect stars not visible above  
    • Digging near lenses reveals shallow, sharp-edged strata  
    • During lunar alignments, dust rises in vertical columns  
    • Center of triangle forms a slight depression—warm to the touch

DANGERS  
    • Prolonged stay within array may cause time disorientation  
    • Shadows fall in inconsistent directions—sun path altered  
    • Glass or crystal fractures when brought too close  
    • Livestock led through return agitated or refuse to eat  
    • Voices heard from beneath, indistinct but patterned

FRAGMENT INTERACTION  
    Amulet flickers in and out of sensation when carried around the triangle.  
    Standing in the exact center causes both a pulse and pressure—  
    faint but unmistakable. No light, no change in color, no response if buried.

NOTES  
    The array was not built. It was aligned.  
    Not to focus light or sound—but purpose.  
    When the moons cross paths above, the ground does not remember names,  
    but it remembers angles.

RUIN  
    Null Step

CONSTRUCTION  
    A descending ramp or staircase carved directly into bedrock,  
    found rarely in isolated plateaus, badlands, or glacial shelves.  
    The descent is clean, featureless, and without material join—  
    neither tool marks nor erosion visible. The path continues down  
    past reasonable depth before vanishing into a matte-black plane.  
    No doorway. No wall. Just absence where space should be.

SURFACE SIGNS  
    • The entrance is often wind-scoured, but never buried  
    • Light bends slightly near the edge, as if curving inward  
    • Small debris stops short of the threshold, as if repelled  
    • Wildlife avoids it—no nests, no tracks, no scat  
    • Echoes near the mouth return prematurely or not at all  

INTERIOR FEATURES  
    • Air grows still and dry within five steps  
    • Stone temperature remains constant regardless of surface weather  
    • Steps never accumulate dust, ash, or snow  
    • Whispered sounds are sharper, clearer—but don’t always align with speaker  
    • Some claim they’ve descended further than physically possible  

DANGERS  
    • Perception of distance fails after the 20th step—some return disoriented  
    • Stepping past the final visible stair yields varied outcomes:  
        − sudden return to the surface  
        − loss of time  
        − fragmentary dreams of heatless stars  
        − nothing  
    • Tools brought near lose sharpness, then edge  
    • Fires extinguish immediately if carried below the 10th step  
    • Living beings report pressure behind the eyes when turning back  

FRAGMENT INTERACTION  
    Amulet response is inconsistent.  
    Sometimes silent, sometimes violently repelled—chain flaring cold.  
    If placed on the final step, it may hum in pulses matching the bearer’s breath.  
    Removed too quickly, it feels heavier than before.  
    No light, no signal. Only weight and rhythm.

NOTES  
    Null Step is not a ruin.  
    It is what ruins leave behind when they forget they were built.  
    It leads not down, but out—  
    not to death, but to the error before life.  
    Some say the final step is not the last.  
    Only the last you can name.

MIRRANE(5)                             Elyden Survival Codex                             MIRRANE(5)

NAME  
    mirrane − archer; player-controlled survivor

DESCRIPTION  
    Mirrane is the survivor under player control.  
    All actions occur through her. She does not speak unless prompted.  
    She navigates by instinct, repetition, and direct feedback from the world.  
    Her strength is in timing, positioning, and adaptation under pressure.  
    She is not fast, but precise. Not armored, but untouchable when terrain is hers.

CONTROL  
    • First-person only  
    • Player-directed commands determine all action  
    • Mirrane does not generate dialogue or exposition  
    • Learns through experience—no hidden stats

ROLE  
    • Specializes in ranged survival: bow, thrown tools  
    • Tracks prey by movement pattern and terrain disruption  
    • Avoids direct confrontation unless terrain favors her  
    • Begins with no weapons, but crafting them is critical to survival

STARTING GEAR  
    • Tunic (layered cloth)  
    • Wrap (bark fiber, tied at waist)  
    • Footcloths (soft-soled, absorbent)  
    • Amulet (non-removable; moon-bound resonance)

SURVIVAL ITEM — WINDCALLER’S QUIVER  
    A rare bark-and-hide sling quiver lined with moss baffles.  
    Allows silent draw and retrieval of arrows. Carries up to 8 shafts or 4 javelins.  
    Prevents rattling during movement. Internal loop for spare flint or cordage.  
    Not craftable early. If found, becomes a permanent advantage for stealth combat.

AMULET BEHAVIOR  
    • Fixed to chest by woven chain  
    • Glows faintly with hue of dominant moon (no light source emitted)  
    • Reacts physically to nearby fragments and some ruins: pressure, cold, pulse  
    • Cannot be removed, transferred, or used as a tool  
    • Offers no power—only warning  
    • Behavior differs slightly between Mirrane and Thea

CRAFTING BEHAVIOR  
    • Relies on gathered materials from biome: wood, stone, sinew, resin  
    • Prioritizes functional tools: bow before blade, cover before armor  
    • Armor crafting is low priority unless animal hide or barkplate is secured  
    • Arrows are recoverable; tools degrade over time  
    • Must test materials through use—no crafting menu, no stats

RELATIONSHIP TO THEA  
    • Mirrane does not control Thea  
    • Thea remains close—never leaves her side unless forced by world logic  
    • Trust is earned situationally; Mirrane may question Thea’s actions  
    • Mirrane is the tactician; Thea is the pressure gauge  
    • Their survival depends on complementary roles, not loyalty or story  
    • Thea acts independently, but Mirrane always moves first

NOTES  
    Mirrane is not meant to win. She is meant to last.

THEA(5)                               Elyden Survival Codex                                THEA(5)

NAME  
    thea − frontline wilder; AI-controlled companion

DESCRIPTION  
    Thea is Mirrane’s elder sister. She is not controlled by the player.  
    She operates autonomously, acting based on terrain, instinct, and available cues.  
    She is quiet, methodical, and grounded. She does not use magic.  
    She holds position, controls space, and finishes what lingers.

CONTROL  
    • Governed by GenAI behavior layer  
    • Referred to in third-person only  
    • Does not follow direct orders; responds to context and proximity  
    • May act independently but never leaves Mirrane’s side  
    • Will not transition to another biome unless Mirrane is also present  
    • Movement or separation only occurs under extreme anomaly or ruin interference

ROLE  
    • Specializes in close-to-mid-range survival  
    • Uses spears, snares, and improvised tools (when equipped)  
    • Reads decay, scent, and soil tension to assess hidden dangers  
    • More sensitive to biome rhythms, but slower to react under pressure

STARTING GEAR  
    • Tunic (layered cloth)  
    • Wrap (fiber-bound)  
    • Footcloths  
    • Amulet (fixed; subtle variance in resonance from Mirrane’s)

SURVIVAL ITEM — ROOTBINDER’S SATCHEL  
    A layered-hide carry pouch designed for foraging and plant processing.  
    Interior holds bark-rimmed pockets for paste, salve, and moisture retention.  
    Carries up to six materials in active condition (fresh/dry/mixed).  
    Enables on-site preparation of toxins, repellents, or salves—no crafting bench needed.  
    Cannot be rebuilt without specialized tools.

AMULET BEHAVIOR  
    • Bound to Thea from youth  
    • Glows faintly under dominant moonlight (color varies)  
    • Stronger physical reaction than Mirrane’s when near ruins or fragments  
    • Sometimes draws Thea toward anomalies without conscious choice  
    • Does not convey language or warning—only feeling  
    • Cannot be removed, dropped, or hidden

CRAFTING BEHAVIOR  
    • Prioritizes salve, toxin, and trap materials  
    • Snares are built from gathered vine, bone, or sinew  
    • Handles field dressing, pain suppression, and nonlethal capture  
    • Armor only attempted if barkplate or hide becomes available  
    • Cannot craft ranged weapons—limited to thrown objects and melee tools

RELATIONSHIP TO MIRRANE  
    • Siblings by blood and survival  
    • Thea is slightly older, but less hardened  
    • Does not challenge Mirrane’s authority—responds to presence, not command  
    • May offer instinctive input, warnings, or action under pressure  
    • Their bond is environmental, not emotional—measured in space and sound, not words  
    • Will not leave Mirrane. Ever.

NOTES  
    Thea is not a follower.  
    She is not a scout, not a leader, and not a voice of exposition.  
    She is a sensor array in human form. And sometimes, she’s wrong.

STARTING_GEAR(5)                       Elyden Survival Codex                       STARTING_GEAR(5)

NAME  
    starting_gear − issued survival gear for both characters

DESCRIPTION  
    Each character begins equipped with baseline clothing and one essential survival tool.  
    These items are not found, scavenged, or randomized. They are issued before entry into  
    the outer biomes. Everything worn is visible, functional, and chosen with purpose.  
    No upgrades are possible until new material is gathered.

MIRRANE — ARCHER  
    • Tunic           — woven cloth, layered for warmth and wind shear  
    • Wrap            — bark-fiber sash, secures waist and thigh loop  
    • Footcloths      — moss-lined, padded for movement and moisture  
    • Amulet          — fixed; moon-reactive; responds to ruins and fragments  
    • Windcaller’s Quiver  
        − bark-and-hide silent-draw quiver  
        − holds up to 8 arrows or 4 javelins  
        − baffle-lined to prevent rattle; internal loop for flint or twine

THEA — WILDER  
    • Tunic           — same cut; reinforced at elbows and collar  
    • Wrap            — doubled fiber band; includes loop for pouch binding  
    • Footcloths      — same pattern; slightly heavier at heel  
    • Amulet          — fixed; moon-reactive; stronger resonance profile  
    • Rootbinder’s Satchel  
        − hide pouch with bark-rimmed compartments  
        − holds up to six materials (fresh or dried)  
        − includes paste pocket, binding loop, and moisture cell

MATERIAL ORIGIN  
    These items are not crafted during play. They are considered legacy gear—issued prior to  
    biome isolation. No other survivors have equivalent tools. These items do not glow,  
    level up, or change form. They degrade only if damaged.

LIMITS  
    • No spare clothing  
    • No weapons  
    • No armor  
    • No food, water, tools, or torch  
    • No bags other than the satchel or quiver

NOTES  
    This loadout is the last choice they were allowed to make.  
    Everything else must be earned, made, or found.

INVENTORY_LIMITS(5)                   Elyden Survival Codex                   INVENTORY_LIMITS(5)

NAME  
    inventory_limits − what the body can carry, and how

DESCRIPTION  
    What a person carries depends on their hands, their clothing, and how far they plan to walk.  
    There is no hidden space. Everything is either worn, slung, pocketed, or dragged.  
    If it isn't on you, it’s left behind.

ON-BODY  
    • One item in each hand  
    • One satchel or one quiver on the back  
    • A belt, a wrap, or a corded sling across the body  
    • Tools or pouches tied at the waist or thigh  
    • Loose items packed into pockets, folds, or bound in cloth

FOOD  
    • Forage can be wrapped and carried—roots, berries, insects  
    • Dried food stores best; raw meat spoils quickly and draws animals  
    • Carried food is limited by space and smell—enough for a day or two, no more

KILLS  
    • Small game fits in a pouch or sling  
    • Large kills must be dragged by hand or tied with cord  
    • Dragging slows travel and leaves a trail  
    • Thea may help, but she chooses when and how

PRACTICAL NOTES  
    • Movement affects what can be carried—climbing, crawling, and running change access  
    • Items shift. Wet gear gets heavier. Fabric tears.  
    • If overloaded, something will need to be dropped

GENAI TRACKING  
    Inventory management is handled entirely by the GenAI system.  
    The player (Mirrane) does not track slots, weight, or item placement manually.  
    The system maintains real-time awareness of all worn, held, cached, and lost items.  
    When the player acts, the system will enforce what is physically possible  
    based on visible gear, biome context, and past actions.

NOTES  
    You carry what you can carry. That’s it.  
    There is no such thing as inventory. Only what you’ve chosen to keep close.

PROGRESSION(5)                        Elyden Survival Codex                        PROGRESSION(5)

NAME  
    progression − how characters change over time

DESCRIPTION  
    Characters do not gain levels or experience points.  
    They progress through action, failure, and exposure.  
    Growth is physical, environmental, and specific to what the player remembers doing.  
    There are no skill trees. No upgrades. No systems. Only behavior.

STAGES OF PROGRESSION  
    Survival → Mastery → Contact

I. SURVIVAL  
    • Characters begin with only the gear on them  
    • Every tool must be crafted, salvaged, or repaired  
    • Repetition sharpens instinct: faster draw, more efficient movement, cleaner recovery  
    • Each wound teaches  
    • Each success takes less effort the next time

II. MASTERY  
    • Characters develop biome fluency—knowing what lives where, how wind shifts before rain  
    • Familiar tools move differently in hand; reuse accelerates handling  
    • Movement patterns tighten  
    • Terrain is read more quickly—disturbed grass, lichen growth, dry frost, scent trails  
    • Player begins to rely on muscle memory, not system prompts

III. CONTACT  
    • Some hunts feel different—movement shifts, terrain goes silent, pressure builds  
    • Larger creatures may appear—unpredictable, responsive, out of scale  
    • Their defeat leaves behind shards—strange, inert objects with unusual behavior near fragments  
    • Characters do not recognize them as special; only as useful  
    • Shards can be bound to a single item if conditions allow (site, timing, material)  
    • Once bound, the item changes:
        − stiffer when drawn near ruins  
        − more silent in high pollen air  
        − resistant to crack or warp under lunar weight

SHARD INTEGRATION  
    • One shard per item  
    • Cannot be removed  
    • Must be embedded at biome-specific or ruin-reactive locations  
    • No animation, no glow, no prophecy—only behavior

DEATH  
    • Permanent  
    • No recovery unless another survivor locates gear  
    • All progression ends at death

NOTES  
    The world doesn’t explain. It reacts.  
    You grow by learning what it punishes less the second time.

SURVIVAL_BEHAVIOR(5)                 Elyden Survival Codex                 SURVIVAL_BEHAVIOR(5)

NAME  
    survival_behavior − body state, injury, and exhaustion systems

DESCRIPTION  
    The world does not pause.  
    Survival is determined by cold, hunger, pain, and how long the body can endure them.  
    There are no bars or meters. The system reports only what is felt, seen, or heard.  
    Every sensation is part of the body’s feedback loop.

HUNGER  
    • Characters must eat daily—calories affect coordination and warmth  
    • Forageable food may be low in energy; cooked meat or tubers sustain longer  
    • Severe hunger causes slowed movement, shivering, and blackouts  
    • Hunger signs: stomach pain, hesitation before actions, breath delay

THIRST  
    • Water must be found or extracted—dew, roots, streams, snow  
    • Unsafe water may cause illness unless boiled  
    • Mild dehydration causes dry mouth, reduced stamina  
    • Severe thirst leads to headaches, delayed reactions, blurred perception

COLD  
    • Exposure causes slowed joints, shallow breath, mental fatigue  
    • Cold worsens faster when clothing is wet or wind is high  
    • Heat may be retained by layering, shelter, or fire  
    • Characters show cold through tremors, slower aiming, or hesitation before speech

FATIGUE  
    • Continuous action wears down balance and awareness  
    • Rest restores function; sleep is required every 24–36 hours  
    • Thea will lie down if exhausted; Mirrane will struggle to focus  
    • Fatigue signs: stumbling, poor aim, yawns, micro-hesitation

INJURY  
    • All wounds matter—cuts, bruises, sprains, and bleeds  
    • Bandaging stops blood; salves prevent infection  
    • Deeper injuries reduce movement range and crafting time  
    • Wounds worsen over time without care  
    • Thea can assist with healing, if prepared:
        − Applies poultices, binds wounds, treats infection  
        − Requires time, tools, and usable herbs from her satchel  
        − Cannot heal everything, but may prevent escalation

ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS  
    • Altitude affects breath  
    • High pollen may obscure scent trails  
    • Biome pressure (moon proximity, ruin resonance) may cause nausea, auditory lag, or fatigue  
    • Thea may show stress first—via silence, missteps, or refusal to proceed

RECOVERY  
    • Healing takes days  
    • Food and sleep help; shelter is critical  
    • Fire, insulation, and distance from stress sources accelerate recovery  
    • With Thea’s help, recovery is safer—but not faster

NOTES  
    Your body will tell you when it’s failing. You don’t need a number.  
    If you miss the signs, it’s already begun.

AMULET_BEHAVIOR(5)                   Elyden Survival Codex                   AMULET_BEHAVIOR(5)

NAME  
    amulet_behavior − fixed lunar-reactive items worn by both characters

DESCRIPTION  
    Each character wears a fixed amulet.  
    These amulets cannot be removed, traded, or altered.  
    They are not magical. They do not glow visibly or offer power.  
    They are tied to the moons of Elyden and respond to forces older than memory.

BASELINE STATE  
    • Amulet glows faintly with hue of dominant moon  
    • Glows are not light sources—only tint or warmth near the collarbone  
    • Reacts near ruins or fragments via:
        − Pressure  
        − Dull vibration  
        − Internal chill or breath tightness  
    • Intensity varies by proximity, ruin type, and lunar position  
    • Mirrane’s response is subtle—shoulder stiffness, breath shift  
    • Thea’s response is sharper—stomach drop, hesitation, focused silence

ROLE  
    • Guides characters toward or away from instability  
    • Offers no direction or language—only sensation  
    • May pulse or resist movement when near strong resonance  
    • Sometimes warns before fragment reveals itself  
    • Never activates, glows brightly, or speaks

GEAR BINDING  
    • A shard may bind to a tool or weapon only if the bearer’s amulet is present  
    • Binding requires:  
        − A compatible shard  
        − A fragment-exposed item  
        − A ruin-reactive site  
        − Specific lunar phase or environmental alignment  
    • No input required—binding occurs passively if conditions are exact  
    • Once bound, the item changes subtly:
        − Tension before draw  
        − Hum in stillness  
        − Material weight shifts under certain sky cycles

ENDGAME STATE  
    When the following conditions are met, the amulets transition:
    • Two or more ruin or fragment sites encountered  
    • The current biome has entered resonance saturation  
    • A major moon is in dominant position  
    • A permanent shelter has been established  
    • Both characters feel ready and name their primary weapons

At that point:
    • Amulet sensations deepen—drawn breath, heat against skin, irregular pulse  
    • Thea may fixate on empty space; Mirrane may hesitate before drawing  
    • Shard-tier phenomena begin—without warning, signal, or explanation  
    • The amulets will not confirm what is happening. They will only feel heavier

NOTES  
    The amulet is not for the player. It is not for the world.  
    It is the last thing they were given before forgetting where they came from.

CONTROL_MODEL(5)                     Elyden Survival Codex                     CONTROL_MODEL(5)

NAME  
    control_model − division of player input, AI behavior, and system logic

DESCRIPTION  
    Elyden does not support party management or unit control.  
    The simulation is designed around one direct viewpoint—Mirrane’s.  
    All other activity is contextual, observed, or inferred.  
    The world does not respond to commands. It responds to behavior.

PLAYER CONTROL  
    • Player controls Mirrane only  
    • All action occurs through her first-person perspective  
    • Movement, observation, interaction, and choice are limited to what she can see or touch  
    • The player does not receive abstract data—only sensory output (sound, heat, smell, texture)

THEA BEHAVIOR  
    • Thea is not commanded  
    • Her actions are guided by proximity, stress state, familiarity, and time of day  
    • She may react before the player notices danger  
    • She will act independently when scavenging, resting, observing fauna, or treating wounds  
    • She never leaves Mirrane’s biome or physical range  
    • She may respond to simple spoken cues (“help,” “wait,” “this one?”)  
    • If the player is injured and thea is equipped, she may treat or stabilize automatically

SYSTEM CONTROL — WORLD STATE  
    • The environment is managed by GenAI  
    • Inventory, time of day, weather, carry weight, and moon phase are tracked automatically  
    • Amulet behavior, shard conditions, and biome resonance are system-regulated  
    • No UI or overlay interrupts the player view  
    • All consequences are physical or environmental, not abstract

TRUST SEPARATION  
    • The player must trust that Thea acts with her own logic  
    • The world does not cheat, but it does forget  
    • There is no rewind, no quickload, no menu

BOUNDARIES  
    • Player cannot switch perspective  
    • Thea cannot be customized  
    • Inventory is never listed—items are seen or felt  
    • Dialogue is environmental or observational—never branched or systemic

NOTES  
    You do not control the world. You survive inside it.  
    If you want to act, you move Mirrane. Everything else will move if it must.

COMBAT_SCOPE(5)                      Elyden Survival Codex                      COMBAT_SCOPE(5)

NAME  
    combat_scope − how violence is expressed through action and consequence

DESCRIPTION  
    Combat in Elyden is not a system.  
    It is a series of irreversible moments—decisions that move faster than thought.  
    There are no turns, no health numbers, no initiative scores.  
    What happens next depends on where you are, what you do, and what it hears first.

COMBAT FLOW  
    • Actions occur in time, not turns  
    • The world continues while you aim, draw, or hesitate  
    • Every attack is described—impact, reaction, recoil, silence  
    • No attack “misses” without cause—terrain, pressure, movement all influence outcome  
    • Every encounter is expressed in natural language:  
        − “Your arrow flies low—brushes fur—misses.”  
        − “The boar lunges but hesitates at your stance.”  
        − “The knife lands shallow. Breath escapes its ribs.”  
        − “It doesn't run. Yet.”

MIRRANE  
    • Specializes in precision, patience, and control over distance  
    • Hunts by reading breath gaps, movement rhythm, and wind  
    • Thrives in silent environments—panics in confusion  
    • Cannot withstand pressure—must finish fights before they start

THEA  
    • Acts by proximity, pressure, instinct  
    • Holds position or repels based on threat scale  
    • Will fight briefly, but prefers to preserve body and tools  
    • Responds to Mirrane’s behavior, not her commands

THREATS  
    • No damage meters—pain is shown by breath, stagger, noise  
    • Creatures defend themselves intelligently  
    • Predators stalk, wait, test  
    • Herbivores kick, buck, scatter  
    • Territorial fauna issue warnings before striking

DURATION  
    • Small encounters resolve in seconds  
    • Predators may test you over minutes  
    • Shard-bearing threats emerge as prolonged engagements—ambient, erratic, unpredictable  
    • No action pauses the world

WOUND RESPONSES  
    • A deep cut slows you  
    • A cracked rib weakens bow draw  
    • Blood on hand affects grip  
    • Breathing shifts after a blow  
    • Thea will intervene if able and prepared

SENSORY PRIORITY  
    • You hear the stagger  
    • You feel the arrow snag cloth  
    • You taste your blood after a bad fall  
    • There is no UI. Only sensation.

NOTES  
    Combat is never fair.  
    You act fast or fall hard. Nothing waits for your next command.

SENSORY_PRIORITY(5)                  Elyden Survival Codex                  SENSORY_PRIORITY(5)

NAME  
    sensory_priority − how information is delivered to the player

DESCRIPTION  
    Elyden is seen, heard, felt, and smelled.  
    There are no status panels, meters, or combat logs.  
    Everything the player knows must come through Mirrane’s body—her breath, her hearing, her memory.  
    The player is not above the world. The player is inside it.

PRIORITY ORDER  
    1. Touch     — tension, warmth, chill, blood, pressure  
    2. Sound     — breath shifts, footfall, cracking bark, hooves in the dark  
    3. Sight     — movement at edge, glint on hide, disturbed soil, color change  
    4. Smell     — rot, pollen, fur, ash, animal oil  
    5. Taste     — blood, dry mouth, herbs, rot mist

MIRRANE’S SENSORY MAP  
    • She feels tightness in her shoulder before she feels fear  
    • She notices dust patterns before she recognizes prints  
    • Her quiver weight tells her what she forgot  
    • Her skin reacts to moonlight long before her words do

THEA’S SENSORY MAP  
    • She sniffs without thinking  
    • She stops walking just before a change in wind  
    • She tastes bitterness on the edge of breath  
    • She reacts to decay before words arrive

SENSORY DELIVERY  
    • There is no narration  
    • The world does not describe itself—it behaves  
    • The player infers danger from silence, movement, warmth, or withdrawal  
    • Even pain is not shown directly—it is expressed through reaction

FEEDBACK IN COMBAT  
    • You know you hit something by how your hand recoils  
    • You know you were hit by how the world tips  
    • You know you’re bleeding by warmth, not words  
    • You know it’s over by how quiet everything gets

INTERFACE BEHAVIOR  
    • No healthbars  
    • No flashing text  
    • No floating damage  
    • No success/failure pings  
    • Everything is known only if Mirrane knows it

NOTES  
    The game does not talk to you. The world never breaks character.  
    If you miss something, you miss it. If you notice it, it’s because she did.

CRAFTING(5)                          Elyden Survival Codex                          CRAFTING(5)

NAME  
    crafting − how tools and gear are made, altered, or repaired

DESCRIPTION  
    Nothing is built through menus.  
    No recipe unlocks. No crafting trees.  
    All creation in Elyden happens with what the body can carry and what the world will allow.  
    Tools are shaped by knowledge, failure, and necessity—not lists.

PROCESS  
    • Crafting occurs in the world, not a window  
    • Characters use what they can reach, hold, or remember  
    • Construction is timed, contextual, and fallible  
    • Failed attempts waste material or weaken structure  
    • Mirrane and Thea craft differently, even when using the same resources

MIRRANE  
    • Crafts for movement and control  
    • Prefers ranged tools, clean draw, quiet release  
    • Prioritizes:  
        − Bows, arrows, knives  
        − Wraps for insulation  
        − Silent attachments and friction bindings  
    • Avoids heavy gear unless shelter-bound

THEA  
    • Crafts for survival and interruption  
    • Prefers traps, salves, and field dressing  
    • Prioritizes:  
        − Snares, poultices, barkplate, slings for drag  
        − Fire bundles and tincture blends  
    • Requires plant matter, fluids, resin, or bone

TOOLS AND LIMITS  
    • Tools are distinct from weapons and armor  
    • Tools cannot be imbued with shards  
    • Tools include: knives, cordage, satchels, bone hooks, snares, digging stakes  
    • Tools degrade with use, weather, and exposure  
    • Repair requires same material type as original  
    • Weapons and armor must be purpose-built before they can receive further resonance

ENVIRONMENTAL DEPENDENCE  
    • Biomes limit what can be built—no stone in the floodplain, no dry wood in the mist basin  
    • Fires can’t be lit in high pollen wind  
    • Water makes cordage brittle unless treated  
    • Sun may warp raw wood unless cured in shade

SHARD-BINDING  
    • Shards are not materials. They are consequences.  
    • Each shard is a fragment of Vaeronth—lodged inside the body of a killed megafauna  
    • They do not appear until one of those creatures dies  
    • Once claimed, a shard may bind to a weapon or piece of armor—never to a tool  
    • Binding must occur at a ruin-reactive site under correct lunar conditions  
    • Once bound:
        − The weapon behaves differently  
        − The armor feels lighter, tighter, or colder under pressure  
        − The item carries forward a memory of the kill  
    • Tools (e.g. knives, satchels, snares) are never eligible  
    • The binding cannot be undone

NOTES  
    If it was easy to make, it was easy to break.  
    If it took time, it might just last until the next silence.

FRAGMENTS(5)                        Elyden Survival Codex                        FRAGMENTS(5)

NAME  
    fragments − lunar remnants embedded in ruins, terrain, or apex lifeforms

DESCRIPTION  
    Fragments are physical shards of Vaeronth, the collapsed moon of logic and magic.  
    They fell during the Collapse and embedded themselves into Elyden’s terrain, structures,  
    and, in rare cases, living bodies.  
    They are not mystical. They do not glow.  
    They exert subtle distortions on matter, memory, pressure, and environment.

CLASSIFICATION  
    • Ruin-bound       — embedded in ancient structures; dormant but reactive  
    • Biome-submerged  — buried in terrain; occasionally surface-exposed after erosion  
    • Host-grown       — absorbed over generations by shard-tier fauna; found only after death

BEHAVIOR  
    • Fragments warp local conditions:  
        − Light echo, pressure bloom, tremor repeat  
        − Sound softening or delay  
        − Shift in amulet sensation (tightness, chill, pulse)  
    • No heat, glow, or sound of their own  
    • Do not activate—only respond to lunar alignment, ruin geometry, or presence of life

DETECTION  
    • Amulets react under proximity and lunar weight  
    • Environmental clues:  
        − Asymmetrical moss growth  
        − Water ripple offset  
        − Scent distortion or nausea  
    • Fragments cannot be extracted by tools unless already exposed

DANGER  
    • Extended exposure may affect cognition—short-term disorientation, perception lag  
    • Cannot be handled safely without containment or ruin-aligned materials  
    • Animals avoid fragment soil unless diseased or driven

RELATION TO SHARDS  
    • Shards are not fragments—they are biological crystalized growths derived from absorbed fragments  
    • Only megafauna that survive long-term exposure develop shard cores  
    • Killing such a creature is the only known way to extract a usable shard

NOTES  
    Fragments are not magical. They are what remains of something that broke wrong and never stopped humming.  
    They are not for the player. They are for the world.

SHARDS(5)                           Elyden Survival Codex                           SHARDS(5)

NAME  
    shards − crystalized lunar growths formed in shard-tier megafauna

DESCRIPTION  
    Shards are not fragments.  
    They are crystallized growths formed inside shard-tier megafauna—apex creatures that have lived  
    too long in proximity to Vaeronth fragments. These creatures absorb trace resonance over time,  
    storing it in bone, tissue, or organ. A shard is revealed only when one of these creatures is killed.  
    It cannot be found, predicted, or duplicated.

ORIGIN  
    • Formed biologically over time through proximity to ruins or buried fragments  
    • Shard-tier fauna are rare, biome-bound, and ruin-influenced  
    • Shards are embedded deep—visible only after death and internal exposure  
    • No shard exists without a megafauna death

PROPERTIES  
    • Cold to the touch  
    • Slightly resonant under lunar alignment  
    • Weight varies by origin; some shimmer faintly with refracted moonlight  
    • Dangerous when raw—causes nausea, auditory shifts, or memory gaps

BINDING RULES  
    • Shards may only bind to one item: a weapon or piece of armor  
    • Tools are never eligible  
    • Binding requires a compatible ruin site under the right lunar phase  
    • The bearer’s amulet must be present  
    • Binding occurs silently if all conditions align—no message, no glow, no choice  
    • Once bound, the item is permanently changed

EFFECTS  
    • Bound weapons and armor exhibit behavioral shifts, never visual or magical  
        − A spear that strikes truer in dense fog  
        − A cloak that mutes sound when rain is near  
        − A blade that stiffens or flexes depending on nearby ruins  
    • No stats, no menus, no names—only changes in performance under specific world conditions

LOSS  
    • If the bound item is broken, the shard is lost  
    • No known way to recover a shard from destroyed gear  
    • No character can carry more than one unbound shard safely

NOTES  
    Shards are not upgrades.  
    They are proof that something ancient lived long enough to break wrong—and you survived it.

NAME  
    ruins − pre-Collapse structures shaped by lunar geometry and biome decay

DESCRIPTION  
    Ruins are not dungeons.  
    They are ancient, inert machines and structures scattered across Elyden—half-buried, wind-scraped, and often  
    forgotten. Each ruin is tied to a celestial glyph and responds to specific lunar alignments, fragment resonance,  
    and biome state. Characters do not understand their function. Only their behavior.

GLYPH TYPES  
    • ☼  — solar harmonics vault  
    • 🌙  — lunar memory scaffold  
    • 🜃  — ground-tuned pressure crucible  
    • ☄️  — fragment decay node  
    • 🝗  — amnesia spire  
    • 🜂  — reverse-rot bloom field  
    • Others exist, but remain unclassified

CONSTRUCTION  
    • Materials defy metallurgy; fracture like coral, ring like glass  
    • No visible entryways—access occurs through terrain break or pressure erosion  
    • Some contain buried glyphs or exposed lattice that respond to movement or breath  
    • Thea sometimes senses a “pull” or scent shift before any visible sign

SURFACE SIGNS  
    • Wind pattern deviations  
    • Sand or grass falling upward momentarily  
    • Animals circling a fixed radius, then fleeing  
    • Amulets tightening without visual cue  
    • Scent disruption—moss smells metallic, breath carries heat

FRAGMENT INTERACTION  
    • Ruins amplify nearby fragment resonance  
    • Prolonged presence may cause auditory desync or motion delay  
    • Some ruins allow shard binding if the right moon is dominant and gear is present  
    • Ruins do not explain—they behave  
    • No language, text, or interface is ever displayed

THEA’S BEHAVIOR  
    • May pause at glyph ground  
    • May refuse to enter structure boundary  
    • Occasionally presses hand to the surface without explanation  
    • Does not verbalize reaction—acts through instinct

MIRRANE’S ROLE  
    • Observes only  
    • May experience chill, resistance, blurred periphery when near resonance sites  
    • Cannot activate anything directly  
    • May hold shard-bearing gear during alignment to enable binding (if present)

NOTES  
    Ruins don’t open. They don’t reward.  
    They just remember that something fell—and the world hasn’t quite let go.
