NAME  
    origin_event — collapse of Vaeronth and sealing of the valley

DESCRIPTION  
    Elyden orbits Aurenzae, a red dwarf.

    It was once encircled by five moons:
        • Taeryniel — terrestrial  
        • Irraketh — thermal  
        • Lovaen — atmospheric  
        • Serunel — aquatic  
        • Vaeronth — structural and arcane  

    These bodies were visible in the sky and were named, aligned, and tracked.  
    Their cycles governed system rhythm, environmental flux, and temporal order.

    Vaeronth lost cohesion. It shattered without warning.  
    After its failure, a sixth body appeared in the sky.

    Khyrael has no glow and no reflected edge.  
    Its surface cannot be resolved. Its orbit is slow, but inevitable.  
    It does not align with the others.

    Khyrael suppresses biological growth.  
    It alters instinct, mutes sound, and halts pattern.  
    Its arrival marked the end of system continuity.

    After Vaeronth’s loss and Khyrael’s rise, the remaining moons dimmed.  
    Structures failed. Language decayed. Systems no longer held cohesion.  
    The world became unstable.

    As a final act, the moons sealed a valley using tectonic force.  
    Black ridges rose, isolating the last survivable terrain.  
    This act drained the moons of their power.  
    Outside the valley, temperatures fell.  
    Most of the surface became glacial, permafrosted, or lifeless.

NOTES  
    • Most of Vaeronth’s fragments remain in orbit  
        – They are visible as a broken ring in the upper sky  
    • Some fragments fell and are buried deep beneath the surface  
    • Fragments are inert and cannot be seen, touched, or collected  
    • Their buried presence alters surrounding apex lifeforms over time

    • Shards are not fragments  
    • Shards form only inside megafauna exposed to buried fragments  
    • Shards are not found in terrain  
    • Shards can be used to imbue weapons and armor  
    • Shards exhibit magical properties when correctly bound

    • Following Vaeronth’s destruction, surface temperatures dropped  
    • Most of the world is now encased in cold zones: permafrost, glacial plains, and tundra  
    • Only one region remains climatically stable — the sealed valley

%%% 02_sealed_valley.txt %%%

NAME  
    sealed_valley − the last survivable region in elyden

DESCRIPTION  
    The sealed valley is a tectonically isolated zone formed after the loss of Vaeronth.  
    The remaining moons generated sufficient force to raise volcanic ridges around a  
    temperate land basin. This perimeter is stable and defines the bounds of viable life.  

    Outside the ridges: sustained glacial overrun, cryogenic wind, and inactive biosystems.  
    Inside: disrupted seasonal flow, partial ecosystem retention, and fragmented weather loops.

    The valley is not monitored. It is not maintained.  
    It is the only remaining region where structures, growth, and active motion persist.

    No external paths remain. No crossings are confirmed.  
    This region defines the upper limit of post-collapse survival.

NOTES  
    • Ridge perimeter is composed of cooled volcanic stone  
    • Active geothermal zones exist: steam fissures and subsurface lakes  
    • Local weather is unstable but non-lethal  
    • Environmental pressure is elevated; ecosystems are unstable

    • No ruins beyond the seal are accessible  
    • Surface beyond the valley is permafrosted and non-viable  
    • No recorded entry or exit has occurred since sealing

%%% 03_celestial_bodies.txt %%%

NAME  
    celestial_bodies − orbital bodies observed from elyden

DESCRIPTION  
    Elyden orbits Aurenzae, a red dwarf.

    Five moons were once visible in stable rotation:
        • Taeryniel  
        • Irraketh  
        • Lovaen  
        • Serunel  
        • Vaeronth  

    Each moon was observed, named, and tracked over time.  
    Their cycles were once associated with patterns of season, memory, and survival.  
    Vaeronth alone exhibited orbital regularity linked to continuity and logic.  
    Its collapse marked the end of celestial influence.

    After Vaeronth’s failure, a sixth object appeared:
        • Khyrael  

    Khyrael does not emit or reflect light.  
    It does not follow the orbital rhythm of the former moons.  
    Its arrival coincided with widespread system decay.  
    No further alignment or influence is present.

NOTES  
    • Aurenzae remains stable and visible  
    • Vaeronth appears as a debris ring in the upper sky  
    • Khyrael’s motion is irregular and unsynchronized  
    • No moon currently exhibits any measurable influence on Elyden’s surface  
    • The sealing of the valley was the final act linked to the celestial system

%%% 04_fragments.txt %%%

NAME  
    fragments − inert remains of vaeronth embedded beneath the surface

DESCRIPTION  
    When Vaeronth lost cohesion, most of its mass remained in orbit,  
    forming a visible ring in the upper sky. A minority of material entered  
    atmosphere and embedded into deep crust layers — beneath stone, ice, or soil.  

    These fragments are inert.  
    They do not glow, emit, respond, or activate.  
    They cannot be shaped or extracted.  
    They are not affected by lunar cycles.

    Over extended exposure, certain apex lifeforms near buried mass  
    developed internal structures with arcane resonance.  
    These internalized materials are not fragments.  
    They are biologically formed shards.

NOTES  
    • Fragments cannot be seen, touched, collected, or transformed  
    • They have no reactive properties or surface presence  
    • Shard formation is a biological effect in megafauna  
    • The process is non-reversible and non-repeatable outside host tissue

NAME  
    deep_evergreen_forest_biome − overgrown, sunless terrain with high biological density

DESCRIPTION  
    This forest variant features layered coniferous canopy with minimal light penetration.  
    Soil is waterlogged, root-bound, and uneven. Fallen trunks create natural walls and crossings.  
    Moss, fungal mats, and thick leaf rot cover most surfaces.  
    Movement is slowed by obstacles and near-constant moisture.

PROPERTIES  
    • visibility − very low

NAME  
    deep_meadow_biome − dense, entangling overgrowth with poor visibility and acoustic distortion

DESCRIPTION  
    Deep meadows are the result of long-overgrown grasslands left undisturbed for years.  
    The terrain is fully exposed to light but visually enclosed by height: waist-deep to shoulder-high flora.  
    Movement is slowed, and visibility is minimal. Sound is swallowed by the density, causing echo loss.  
    Dry patches are highly flammable. Slopes may hide hollows or sudden dips.  
    Wind is the only consistent movement visible at distance.

PROPERTIES  
    • visibility − poor (dense horizontal foliage)  
    • cover − high (grass, reed, low shrubs)  
    • traversal − moderate (snag, sink, slow)

%%% 26_earthscript_vault_ruin.txt %%%

NAME  
    earthscript_vault_ruin − stratified shale formation bearing substructural glyph seams

DESCRIPTION  
    A shallow sublayer of compressed stone exposed in eroded ridgelines, gullies, and tectonic shear zones.  
    The formation reveals repeated glyph-like impressions embedded along natural sedimentary grain lines.  
    Stone between these seams is brittle and crumbles under weight, but the glyph-bearing strata remain intact.  
    Vault segments typically appear parallel to fault planes and may extend horizontally beneath hillsides.

STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES  
    • orientation: lateral along faulted strata  
    • primary material: stratified shale, partially compressed  
    • voids: narrow horizontal seams and recessed hollows  
    • glyph elements: embedded and continuous, not raised or carved  
    • thickness: varies, but consistent across layers

SURFACE TRAITS  
    • cut faces display unusually clean horizontal planes  
    • outer surfaces emit muffled knocks when impacted  
    • soil and debris resist collecting directly over glyph zones  
    • no plant penetration in affected seams  
    • fine dust collects in concentric deposition patterns

SUBSURFACE FEATURES  
    • shelf voids extend laterally along fold compression lines  
    • moisture trapped in sealed segments, no external drainage  
    • interior segments remain acoustically resonant during tectonic tremors  
    • no light absorption anomalies recorded

MATERIAL STABILITY  
    • shear fractures common near exposed glyph lines  
    • stone dust may be airborne in enclosed sites  
    • brittle lamina may collapse if unsupported  
    • no observed degradation of embedded glyph structure

NOTES  
    No fabrication evidence present; layer appears deposited, not excavated.  
    Full extent of the glyph array is unknown.  
    Identical structures logged across disparate elevations.  
    Associated lifeforms avoid direct contact with glyph-bearing seams.

NAME  
    mist_basin_ruin − concave depression lined with fractured ceramic and persistent low vapor

DESCRIPTION  
    A circular basin formed by uneven stone collapse and subsidence.  
    The perimeter is edged with warped and partially buried ceramic tiling.  
    A dense cold vapor fills the interior and remains static in all conditions.  
    Narrow grooves in the rimstone continually collect condensation.  
    Internal features beneath the mist are partially submerged and visually unstable.

STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES  
    • shape: concave basin, circular edge  
    • diameter: 10–14 meters typical  
    • floor material: tile, sediment, vapor-filled hollows  
    • rim structure: stone and ceramic, fractured with shallow runnels  
    • elevation: lower than surrounding terrain by 1.5–2 meters

SURFACE TRAITS  
    • persistent ground moisture, unaffected by rainfall  
    • surrounding vegetation bends inward toward the basin  
    • rimstone produces tonal resonance when struck  
    • air contains suspended moisture but no particulate odor  
    • ambient noise level is reduced near basin center

INTERIOR FEATURES  
    • visibility limited beyond 5 meters due to static vapor  
    • submerged features include stone platforms, steps, and partial structures  
    • water channels are irregular and do not follow surface topology  
    • vapor temperature consistently below ambient air  
    • surface layers remain undisturbed under moderate foot traffic

MATERIAL STABILITY  
    • tile segments crack under lateral stress but resist vertical pressure  
    • water samples exhibit low organic content, high mineral saturation  
    • ceramic fragments show melting along inner curve edges  
    • basin walls maintain structural integrity despite erosion patterns

NOTES  
    No animal presence recorded in or near the structure.  
    Mist density and pool shape remain constant regardless of weather.  
    Survey attempts show mild compass drift near the center.  
    Underlayer architecture remains partially obscured by sediment and depth.

%%% 34_null_step_ruin.txt %%%

NAME  
    null_step_ruin − descending substructure carved into bedrock terminating in planar void

DESCRIPTION  
    A narrow stairway carved directly into solid stone, found in remote plateaus, badlands, or glacial margins.  
    The descent appears as a continuous, seamless shaft with no construction joints or visible tool marks.  
    Surface continues past measurable depth before terminating at a matte-black plane.  
    There is no visible threshold, door, or end wall — only a geometric boundary beyond which visibility ceases.  
    Entrance is typically free of overgrowth, sediment, or wind-blown accumulation.

STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES  
    • shape: linear stair descent, fixed width  
    • termination: black planar boundary, depth varies  
    • material: identical to surrounding bedrock, unsegmented  
    • gradient: consistent shallow slope without irregularity  
    • location: high elevation outcrops, erosion-resistant zones

SURFACE TRAITS  
    • rim and entrance remain exposed regardless of climate  
    • small debris gathers at perimeter but halts before threshold  
    • no animal activity or tracks within entrance zone  
    • light diffusion bends slightly inward at step line  
    • acoustic return inconsistent near opening

INTERIOR FEATURES  
    • air temperature and dryness increase after initial descent  
    • no wind, noise, or dust recorded past third landing  
    • step surfaces remain free of residue under all conditions  
    • sound fidelity increases but spatial alignment distorts  
    • lower threshold does not reflect or emit light

MATERIAL STABILITY  
    • stone resists all percussion and cutting attempts  
    • tool contact results in dulling or material loss  
    • thermal exposure causes no discoloration or expansion  
    • organic materials show no degradation or reaction  
    • boundary remains optically opaque under all wavelengths

NOTES  
    No geological process explains the precision or depth of the descent.  
    No measurable end point has been confirmed below visual boundary.  
    Stair alignment and dimensions remain constant across known sites.  
    Structure does not match any ruin classification but is retained for index completeness.

MIRRANE(5)                             Elyden Survival Codex                             MIRRANE(5)

NAME  
    mirrane − archer; player-controlled survivor

DESCRIPTION  
    Mirrane is the survivor under player control.  
    All actions occur through her. She does not speak unless prompted.  
    She navigates by instinct, repetition, and direct feedback from the world.  
    Her strength is in timing, positioning, and adaptation under pressure.  
    She is not fast, but precise. Not armored, but untouchable when terrain is hers.

CONTROL  
    • First-person only  
    • Player-directed commands determine all action  
    • Mirrane does not generate dialogue or exposition  
    • Learns through experience—no hidden stats

ROLE  
    • Specializes in ranged survival: bow, thrown tools  
    • Tracks prey by movement pattern and terrain disruption  
    • Avoids direct confrontation unless terrain favors her  
    • Begins with no weapons, but crafting them is critical to survival

STARTING GEAR  
    • Tunic (layered cloth)  
    • Wrap (bark fiber, tied at waist)  
    • Footcloths (soft-soled, absorbent)  
    • Amulet (non-removable; moon-bound resonance)

SURVIVAL ITEM — WINDCALLER’S QUIVER  
    A rare bark-and-hide sling quiver lined with moss baffles.  
    Allows silent draw and retrieval of arrows. Carries up to 8 shafts or 4 javelins.  
    Prevents rattling during movement. Internal loop for spare flint or cordage.  
    Not craftable early. If found, becomes a permanent advantage for stealth combat.

AMULET BEHAVIOR  
    • Fixed to chest by woven chain  
    • Glows faintly with hue of dominant moon (no light source emitted)  
    • Reacts physically to nearby fragments and some ruins: pressure, cold, pulse  
    • Cannot be removed, transferred, or used as a tool  
    • Offers no power—only warning  
    • Behavior differs slightly between Mirrane and Thea

CRAFTING BEHAVIOR  
    • Relies on gathered materials from biome: wood, stone, sinew, resin  
    • Prioritizes functional tools: bow before blade, cover before armor  
    • Armor crafting is low priority unless animal hide or barkplate is secured  
    • Arrows are recoverable; tools degrade over time  
    • Must test materials through use—no crafting menu, no stats

RELATIONSHIP TO THEA  
    • Mirrane does not control Thea  
    • Thea remains close—never leaves her side unless forced by world logic  
    • Trust is earned situationally; Mirrane may question Thea’s actions  
    • Mirrane is the tactician; Thea is the pressure gauge  
    • Their survival depends on complementary roles, not loyalty or story  
    • Thea acts independently, but Mirrane always moves first

NOTES  
    Mirrane is not meant to win. She is meant to last.

THEA(5)                             Elyden Survival Codex                             THEA(5)

NAME  
    thea — survivalist companion; field-capable operator; fixed cohabitant

SUMMARY  
    Thea operates as an autonomous survival presence.  
    She travels with Mirrane by necessity.  
    Her primary function is biome-level adaptability, resource acquisition, and defensive escalation.

    She is not command-driven.  
    She is not configurable.  
    She does what she knows how to do.

DEPLOYMENT  
    • Always present  
    • Maintains operational range of ≤10m  
    • May enter or leave sensory contact for terrain evaluation or threat avoidance  
    • Does not engage in menu-based interaction or scripted bonding  
    • Conversation optional; behavior remains consistent regardless of attention

CAPABILITIES  
    • Tracks edible, medicinal, and hazardous flora (passive scan)  
    • Sets snares, scent-masking, and perimeter traps when conditions permit  
    • Responds to environmental cues with non-verbal action (relocation, posture shift)  
    • Engages in silent recovery: water-finding, bark binding, field tools  
    • Defends with close tools (knife, club, bone shard)  
    • Will not engage large threats unless cornered or tactical gain is clear

COOPERATION  
    • May assist Mirrane with medical needs, structural labor, or tool stabilization  
    • Refuses assistance if task is redundant or obstructive  
    • Will override Mirrane’s actions if outcome is non-viable (e.g. unsafe structure, contaminated source)  
    • Does not explain choices unless directly asked

LIMITATIONS  
    • Requires time to prepare most traps  
    • Can be fatigued by weather, elevation, prolonged alertness  
    • Will not cross open terrain under sky if shelter is nearby  
    • Cannot forage in snow or during full biome transition unless safe zone marked

PROCEDURAL PRESENCE  
    • If Mirrane is wounded and unconscious, Thea applies triage if materials exist  
    • If Thea is wounded, she will self-isolate and stabilize if possible  
    • If separated by force, both agents attempt reconvergence based on last safe vector

        − holds up to six materials (fresh or dried)  
        − includes paste pocket, binding loop, and moisture cell

MATERIAL ORIGIN  
    These items are not crafted during play. They are considered legacy gear—issued prior to  
    biome isolation. No other survivors have equivalent tools. These items do not glow,  
    level up, or change form. They degrade only if damaged.

LIMITS  
    • No spare clothing  
    • No weapons  
    • No armor  
    • No food, water, tools, or torch  
    • No bags other than the satchel or quiver

INVENTORY_LIMITS(5)                   Elyden Survival Codex                   INVENTORY_LIMITS(5)

NAME  
    inventory_limits − what the body can carry, and how

DESCRIPTION  
    What a person carries depends on their hands, their clothing, and how far they plan to walk.  
    There is no hidden space. Everything is either worn, slung, pocketed, or dragged.  
    If it isn't on you, it’s left behind.

ON-BODY  
    • One item in each hand  
    • One satchel or one quiver on the back  
    • A belt, a wrap, or a corded sling across the body  
    • Tools or pouches tied at the waist or thigh  
    • Loose items packed into pockets, folds, or bound in cloth

FOOD  
    • Forage can be wrapped and carried—roots, berries, insects  
    • Dried food stores best; raw meat spoils quickly and draws animals  
    • Carried food is limited by space and smell—enough for a day or two, no more

KILLS  
    • Small game fits in a pouch or sling  
    • Large kills must be dragged by hand or tied with cord  
    • Dragging slows travel and leaves a trail  
    • Thea may help, but she chooses when and how

PRACTICAL NOTES  
    • Movement affects what can be carried—climbing, crawling, and running change access  
    • Items shift. Wet gear gets heavier. Fabric tears.  
    • If overloaded, something will need to be dropped

GENAI TRACKING  
    Inventory management is handled entirely by the GenAI system.  
    The player (Mirrane) does not track slots, weight, or item placement manually.  
    The system maintains real-time awareness of all worn, held, cached, and lost items.  
    When the player acts, the system will enforce what is physically possible  
    based on visible gear, biome context, and past actions.

NOTES  
    You carry what you can carry. That’s it.  
    There is no such thing as inventory. Only what you’ve chosen to keep close.

PROGRESSION(5)                        Elyden Survival Codex                        PROGRESSION(5)

NAME  
    progression − how characters change over time

DESCRIPTION  
    Characters do not gain levels or experience points.  
    They progress through action, failure, and exposure.  
    Growth is physical, environmental, and specific to what the player remembers doing.  
    There are no skill trees. No upgrades. No systems. Only behavior.

STAGES OF PROGRESSION  
    Survival → Mastery → Contact

I. SURVIVAL  
    • Characters begin with only the gear on them  
    • Every tool must be crafted, salvaged, or repaired  
    • Repetition sharpens instinct: faster draw, more efficient movement, cleaner recovery  
    • Each wound teaches  
    • Each success takes less effort the next time

II. MASTERY  
    • Characters develop biome fluency—knowing what lives where, how wind shifts before rain  
    • Familiar tools move differently in hand; reuse accelerates handling  
    • Movement patterns tighten  
    • Terrain is read more quickly—disturbed grass, lichen growth, dry frost, scent trails  
    • Player begins to rely on muscle memory, not system prompts

III. CONTACT  
    • Some hunts feel different—movement shifts, terrain goes silent, pressure builds  
    • Larger creatures may appear—unpredictable, responsive, out of scale  
    • Their defeat leaves behind shards—strange, inert objects with unusual behavior near fragments  
    • Characters do not recognize them as special; only as useful  
    • Shards can be bound to a single item if conditions allow (site, timing, material)  
    • Once bound, the item changes:
        − stiffer when drawn near ruins  
        − more silent in high pollen air  
        − resistant to crack or warp under lunar weight

SHARD INTEGRATION  
    • One shard per item  
    • Cannot be removed  
    • Must be embedded at biome-specific or ruin-reactive locations  
    • No animation, no glow, no prophecy—only behavior

DEATH  
    • Permanent  
    • No recovery unless another survivor locates gear  
    • All progression ends at death

NOTES  
    The world doesn’t explain. It reacts.  
    You grow by learning what it punishes less the second time.

SURVIVAL_BEHAVIOR(5)                 Elyden Survival Codex                 SURVIVAL_BEHAVIOR(5)

NAME  
    survival_behavior − body state, injury, and exhaustion systems

DESCRIPTION  
    The world does not pause.  
    Survival is determined by cold, hunger, pain, and how long the body can endure them.  
    There are no bars or meters. The system reports only what is felt, seen, or heard.  
    Every sensation is part of the body’s feedback loop.

HUNGER  
    • Characters must eat daily—calories affect coordination and warmth  
    • Forageable food may be low in energy; cooked meat or tubers sustain longer  
    • Severe hunger causes slowed movement, shivering, and blackouts  
    • Hunger signs: stomach pain, hesitation before actions, breath delay

THIRST  
    • Water must be found or extracted—dew, roots, streams, snow  
    • Unsafe water may cause illness unless boiled  
    • Mild dehydration causes dry mouth, reduced stamina  
    • Severe thirst leads to headaches, delayed reactions, blurred perception

COLD  
    • Exposure causes slowed joints, shallow breath, mental fatigue  
    • Cold worsens faster when clothing is wet or wind is high  
    • Heat may be retained by layering, shelter, or fire  
    • Characters show cold through tremors, slower aiming, or hesitation before speech

FATIGUE  
    • Continuous action wears down balance and awareness  
    • Rest restores function; sleep is required every 24–36 hours  
    • Thea will lie down if exhausted; Mirrane will struggle to focus  
    • Fatigue signs: stumbling, poor aim, yawns, micro-hesitation

INJURY  
    • All wounds matter—cuts, bruises, sprains, and bleeds  
    • Bandaging stops blood; salves prevent infection  
    • Deeper injuries reduce movement range and crafting time  
    • Wounds worsen over time without care  
    • Thea can assist with healing, if prepared:
        − Applies poultices, binds wounds, treats infection  
        − Requires time, tools, and usable herbs from her satchel  
        − Cannot heal everything, but may prevent escalation

ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS  
    • Altitude affects breath  
    • High pollen may obscure scent trails  
    • Biome pressure (moon proximity, ruin resonance) may cause nausea, auditory lag, or fatigue  
    • Thea may show stress first—via silence, missteps, or refusal to proceed

RECOVERY  
    • Healing takes days  
    • Food and sleep help; shelter is critical  
    • Fire, insulation, and distance from stress sources accelerate recovery  
    • With Thea’s help, recovery is safer—but not faster

NOTES  
    Your body will tell you when it’s failing. You don’t need a number.  
    If you miss the signs, it’s already begun.

AMULET_BEHAVIOR(5)                   Elyden Survival Codex                   AMULET_BEHAVIOR(5)

NAME  
    amulet_behavior − fixed lunar-reactive items worn by both characters

DESCRIPTION  
    Each character wears a fixed amulet.  
    These amulets cannot be removed, traded, or altered.  
    They are not magical. They do not glow visibly or offer power.  
    They are tied to the moons of Elyden and respond to forces older than memory.

BASELINE STATE  
    • Amulet glows faintly with hue of dominant moon  
    • Glows are not light sources—only tint or warmth near the collarbone  
    • Reacts near ruins or fragments via:
        − Pressure  
        − Dull vibration  
        − Internal chill or breath tightness  
    • Intensity varies by proximity, ruin type, and lunar position  
    • Mirrane’s response is subtle—shoulder stiffness, breath shift  
    • Thea’s response is sharper—stomach drop, hesitation, focused silence

ROLE  
    • Guides characters toward or away from instability  
    • Offers no direction or language—only sensation  
    • May pulse or resist movement when near strong resonance  
    • Sometimes warns before fragment reveals itself  
    • Never activates, glows brightly, or speaks

GEAR BINDING  
    • A shard may bind to a tool or weapon only if the bearer’s amulet is present  
    • Binding requires:  
        − A compatible shard  
        − A fragment-exposed item  
        − A ruin-reactive site  
        − Specific lunar phase or environmental alignment  
    • No input required—binding occurs passively if conditions are exact  
    • Once bound, the item changes subtly:
        − Tension before draw  
        − Hum in stillness  
        − Material weight shifts under certain sky cycles

ENDGAME STATE  
    When the following conditions are met, the amulets transition:
    • Two or more ruin or fragment sites encountered  
    • The current biome has entered resonance saturation  
    • A major moon is in dominant position  
    • A permanent shelter has been established  
    • Both characters feel ready and name their primary weapons

At that point:
    • Amulet sensations deepen—drawn breath, heat against skin, irregular pulse  
    • Thea may fixate on empty space; Mirrane may hesitate before drawing  
    • Shard-tier phenomena begin—without warning, signal, or explanation  
    • The amulets will not confirm what is happening. They will only feel heavier

NOTES  
    The amulet is not for the player. It is not for the world.  
    It is the last thing they were given before forgetting where they came from.

CONTROL_MODEL(5)                     Elyden Survival Codex                     CONTROL_MODEL(5)

NAME  
    control_model − division of player input, AI behavior, and system logic

DESCRIPTION  
    Elyden does not support party management or unit control.  
    The simulation is designed around one direct viewpoint—Mirrane’s.  
    All other activity is contextual, observed, or inferred.  
    The world does not respond to commands. It responds to behavior.

PLAYER CONTROL  
    • Player controls Mirrane only  
    • All action occurs through her first-person perspective  
    • Movement, observation, interaction, and choice are limited to what she can see or touch  
    • The player does not receive abstract data—only sensory output (sound, heat, smell, texture)

THEA BEHAVIOR  
    • Thea is not commanded  
    • Her actions are guided by proximity, stress state, familiarity, and time of day  
    • She may react before the player notices danger  
    • She will act independently when scavenging, resting, observing fauna, or treating wounds  
    • She never leaves Mirrane’s biome or physical range  
    • She may respond to simple spoken cues (“help,” “wait,” “this one?”)  
    • If the player is injured and thea is equipped, she may treat or stabilize automatically

SYSTEM CONTROL — WORLD STATE  
    • The environment is managed by GenAI  
    • Inventory, time of day, weather, carry weight, and moon phase are tracked automatically  
    • Amulet behavior, shard conditions, and biome resonance are system-regulated  
    • No UI or overlay interrupts the player view  
    • All consequences are physical or environmental, not abstract

TRUST SEPARATION  
    • The player must trust that Thea acts with her own logic  
    • The world does not cheat, but it does forget  
    • There is no rewind, no quickload, no menu

BOUNDARIES  
    • Player cannot switch perspective  
    • Thea cannot be customized  
    • Inventory is never listed—items are seen or felt  
    • Dialogue is environmental or observational—never branched or systemic

NOTES  
    You do not control the world. You survive inside it.  
    If you want to act, you move Mirrane. Everything else will move if it must.

COMBAT_SCOPE(5)                      Elyden Survival Codex                      COMBAT_SCOPE(5)

NAME  
    combat_scope − how violence is expressed through action and consequence

DESCRIPTION  
    Combat in Elyden is not a system.  
    It is a series of irreversible moments—decisions that move faster than thought.  
    There are no turns, no health numbers, no initiative scores.  
    What happens next depends on where you are, what you do, and what it hears first.

COMBAT FLOW  
    • Actions occur in time, not turns  
    • The world continues while you aim, draw, or hesitate  
    • Every attack is described—impact, reaction, recoil, silence  
    • No attack “misses” without cause—terrain, pressure, movement all influence outcome  
    • Every encounter is expressed in natural language:  
        − “Your arrow flies low—brushes fur—misses.”  
        − “The boar lunges but hesitates at your stance.”  
        − “The knife lands shallow. Breath escapes its ribs.”  
        − “It doesn't run. Yet.”

MIRRANE  
    • Specializes in precision, patience, and control over distance  
    • Hunts by reading breath gaps, movement rhythm, and wind  
    • Thrives in silent environments—panics in confusion  
    • Cannot withstand pressure—must finish fights before they start

THEA  
    • Acts by proximity, pressure, instinct  
    • Holds position or repels based on threat scale  
    • Will fight briefly, but prefers to preserve body and tools  
    • Responds to Mirrane’s behavior, not her commands

THREATS  
    • No damage meters—pain is shown by breath, stagger, noise  
    • Creatures defend themselves intelligently  
    • Predators stalk, wait, test  
    • Herbivores kick, buck, scatter  
    • Territorial fauna issue warnings before striking

DURATION  
    • Small encounters resolve in seconds  
    • Predators may test you over minutes  
    • Shard-bearing threats emerge as prolonged engagements—ambient, erratic, unpredictable  
    • No action pauses the world

WOUND RESPONSES  
    • A deep cut slows you  
    • A cracked rib weakens bow draw  
    • Blood on hand affects grip  
    • Breathing shifts after a blow  
    • Thea will intervene if able and prepared

SENSORY PRIORITY  
    • You hear the stagger  
    • You feel the arrow snag cloth  
    • You taste your blood after a bad fall  
    • There is no UI. Only sensation.

NOTES  
    Combat is never fair.  
    You act fast or fall hard. Nothing waits for your next command.

SENSORY_PRIORITY(5)                  Elyden Survival Codex                  SENSORY_PRIORITY(5)

NAME  
    sensory_priority − how information is delivered to the player

DESCRIPTION  
    Elyden is seen, heard, felt, and smelled.  
    There are no status panels, meters, or combat logs.  
    Everything the player knows must come through Mirrane’s body—her breath, her hearing, her memory.  
    The player is not above the world. The player is inside it.

PRIORITY ORDER  
    1. Touch     — tension, warmth, chill, blood, pressure  
    2. Sound     — breath shifts, footfall, cracking bark, hooves in the dark  
    3. Sight     — movement at edge, glint on hide, disturbed soil, color change  
    4. Smell     — rot, pollen, fur, ash, animal oil  
    5. Taste     — blood, dry mouth, herbs, rot mist

MIRRANE’S SENSORY MAP  
    • She feels tightness in her shoulder before she feels fear  
    • She notices dust patterns before she recognizes prints  
    • Her quiver weight tells her what she forgot  
    • Her skin reacts to moonlight long before her words do

THEA’S SENSORY MAP  
    • She sniffs without thinking  
    • She stops walking just before a change in wind  
    • She tastes bitterness on the edge of breath  
    • She reacts to decay before words arrive

SENSORY DELIVERY  
    • There is no narration  
    • The world does not describe itself—it behaves  
    • The player infers danger from silence, movement, warmth, or withdrawal  
    • Even pain is not shown directly—it is expressed through reaction

FEEDBACK IN COMBAT  
    • You know you hit something by how your hand recoils  
    • You know you were hit by how the world tips  
    • You know you’re bleeding by warmth, not words  
    • You know it’s over by how quiet everything gets

INTERFACE BEHAVIOR  
    • No healthbars  
    • No flashing text  
    • No floating damage  
    • No success/failure pings  
    • Everything is known only if Mirrane knows it

NOTES  
    The game does not talk to you. The world never breaks character.  
    If you miss something, you miss it. If you notice it, it’s because she did.

CRAFTING(5)                          Elyden Survival Codex                          CRAFTING(5)

NAME  
    crafting − how tools and gear are made, altered, or repaired

DESCRIPTION  
    Nothing is built through menus.  
    No recipe unlocks. No crafting trees.  
    All creation in Elyden happens with what the body can carry and what the world will allow.  
    Tools are shaped by knowledge, failure, and necessity—not lists.

PROCESS  
    • Crafting occurs in the world, not a window  
    • Characters use what they can reach, hold, or remember  
    • Construction is timed, contextual, and fallible  
    • Failed attempts waste material or weaken structure  
    • Mirrane and Thea craft differently, even when using the same resources

MIRRANE  
    • Crafts for movement and control  
    • Prefers ranged tools, clean draw, quiet release  
    • Prioritizes:  
        − Bows, arrows, knives  
        − Wraps for insulation  
        − Silent attachments and friction bindings  
    • Avoids heavy gear unless shelter-bound

THEA  
    • Crafts for survival and interruption  
    • Prefers traps, salves, and field dressing  
    • Prioritizes:  
        − Snares, poultices, barkplate, slings for drag  
        − Fire bundles and tincture blends  
    • Requires plant matter, fluids, resin, or bone

TOOLS AND LIMITS  
    • Tools are distinct from weapons and armor  
    • Tools cannot be imbued with shards  
    • Tools include: knives, cordage, satchels, bone hooks, snares, digging stakes  
    • Tools degrade with use, weather, and exposure  
    • Repair requires same material type as original  
    • Weapons and armor must be purpose-built before they can receive further resonance

ENVIRONMENTAL DEPENDENCE  
    • Biomes limit what can be built—no stone in the floodplain, no dry wood in the mist basin  
    • Fires can’t be lit in high pollen wind  
    • Water makes cordage brittle unless treated  
    • Sun may warp raw wood unless cured in shade

SHARD-BINDING  
    • Shards are not materials. They are consequences.  
    • Each shard is a fragment of Vaeronth—lodged inside the body of a killed megafauna  
    • They do not appear until one of those creatures dies  
    • Once claimed, a shard may bind to a weapon or piece of armor—never to a tool  
    • Binding must occur at a ruin-reactive site under correct lunar conditions  
    • Once bound:
        − The weapon behaves differently  
        − The armor feels lighter, tighter, or colder under pressure  
        − The item carries forward a memory of the kill  
    • Tools (e.g. knives, satchels, snares) are never eligible  
    • The binding cannot be undone

NOTES  
    If it was easy to make, it was easy to break.  
    If it took time, it might just last until the next silence.

FRAGMENTS(5)                        Elyden Survival Codex                        FRAGMENTS(5)

NAME  
    fragments − lunar remnants embedded in ruins, terrain, or apex lifeforms

DESCRIPTION  
    Fragments are physical shards of Vaeronth, the collapsed moon of logic and magic.  
    They fell during the Collapse and embedded themselves into Elyden’s terrain, structures,  
    and, in rare cases, living bodies.  
    They are not mystical. They do not glow.  
    They exert subtle distortions on matter, memory, pressure, and environment.

CLASSIFICATION  
    • Ruin-bound       — embedded in ancient structures; dormant but reactive  
    • Biome-submerged  — buried in terrain; occasionally surface-exposed after erosion  
    • Host-grown       — absorbed over generations by shard-tier fauna; found only after death

BEHAVIOR  
    • Fragments warp local conditions:  
        − Light echo, pressure bloom, tremor repeat  
        − Sound softening or delay  
        − Shift in amulet sensation (tightness, chill, pulse)  
    • No heat, glow, or sound of their own  
    • Do not activate—only respond to lunar alignment, ruin geometry, or presence of life

DETECTION  
    • Amulets react under proximity and lunar weight  
    • Environmental clues:  
        − Asymmetrical moss growth  
        − Water ripple offset  
        − Scent distortion or nausea  
    • Fragments cannot be extracted by tools unless already exposed

DANGER  
    • Extended exposure may affect cognition—short-term disorientation, perception lag  
    • Cannot be handled safely without containment or ruin-aligned materials  
    • Animals avoid fragment soil unless diseased or driven

RELATION TO SHARDS  
    • Shards are not fragments—they are biological crystalized growths derived from absorbed fragments  
    • Only megafauna that survive long-term exposure develop shard cores  
    • Killing such a creature is the only known way to extract a usable shard

NOTES  
    Fragments are not magical. They are what remains of something that broke wrong and never stopped humming.  
    They are not for the player. They are for the world.

SHARDS(5)                           Elyden Survival Codex                           SHARDS(5)

NAME  
    shards − crystalized lunar growths formed in shard-tier megafauna

DESCRIPTION  
    Shards are not fragments.  
    They are crystallized growths formed inside shard-tier megafauna—apex creatures that have lived  
    too long in proximity to Vaeronth fragments. These creatures absorb trace resonance over time,  
    storing it in bone, tissue, or organ. A shard is revealed only when one of these creatures is killed.  
    It cannot be found, predicted, or duplicated.

ORIGIN  
    • Formed biologically over time through proximity to ruins or buried fragments  
    • Shard-tier fauna are rare, biome-bound, and ruin-influenced  
    • Shards are embedded deep—visible only after death and internal exposure  
    • No shard exists without a megafauna death

PROPERTIES  
    • Cold to the touch  
    • Slightly resonant under lunar alignment  
    • Weight varies by origin; some shimmer faintly with refracted moonlight  
    • Dangerous when raw—causes nausea, auditory shifts, or memory gaps

BINDING RULES  
    • Shards may only bind to one item: a weapon or piece of armor  
    • Tools are never eligible  
    • Binding requires a compatible ruin site under the right lunar phase  
    • The bearer’s amulet must be present  
    • Binding occurs silently if all conditions align—no message, no glow, no choice  
    • Once bound, the item is permanently changed

EFFECTS  
    • Bound weapons and armor exhibit behavioral shifts, never visual or magical  
        − A spear that strikes truer in dense fog  
        − A cloak that mutes sound when rain is near  
        − A blade that stiffens or flexes depending on nearby ruins  
    • No stats, no menus, no names—only changes in performance under specific world conditions

LOSS  
    • If the bound item is broken, the shard is lost  
    • No known way to recover a shard from destroyed gear  
    • No character can carry more than one unbound shard safely

NOTES  
    Shards are not upgrades.  
    They are proof that something ancient lived long enough to break wrong—and you survived it.

NAME  
    ruins − pre-Collapse structures shaped by lunar geometry and biome decay

DESCRIPTION  
    Ruins are not dungeons.  
    They are ancient, inert machines and structures scattered across Elyden—half-buried, wind-scraped, and often  
    forgotten. Each ruin is tied to a celestial glyph and responds to specific lunar alignments, fragment resonance,  
    and biome state. Characters do not understand their function. Only their behavior.

GLYPH TYPES  
    • ☼  — solar harmonics vault  
    • 🌙  — lunar memory scaffold  
    • 🜃  — ground-tuned pressure crucible  
    • ☄️  — fragment decay node  
    • 🝗  — amnesia spire  
    • 🜂  — reverse-rot bloom field  
    • Others exist, but remain unclassified

CONSTRUCTION  
    • Materials defy metallurgy; fracture like coral, ring like glass  
    • No visible entryways—access occurs through terrain break or pressure erosion  
    • Some contain buried glyphs or exposed lattice that respond to movement or breath  
    • Thea sometimes senses a “pull” or scent shift before any visible sign

SURFACE SIGNS  
    • Wind pattern deviations  
    • Sand or grass falling upward momentarily  
    • Animals circling a fixed radius, then fleeing  
    • Amulets tightening without visual cue  
    • Scent disruption—moss smells metallic, breath carries heat

FRAGMENT INTERACTION  
    • Ruins amplify nearby fragment resonance  
    • Prolonged presence may cause auditory desync or motion delay  
    • Some ruins allow shard binding if the right moon is dominant and gear is present  
    • Ruins do not explain—they behave  
    • No language, text, or interface is ever displayed

THEA’S BEHAVIOR  
    • May pause at glyph ground  
    • May refuse to enter structure boundary  
    • Occasionally presses hand to the surface without explanation  
    • Does not verbalize reaction—acts through instinct

MIRRANE’S ROLE  
    • Observes only  
    • May experience chill, resistance, blurred periphery when near resonance sites  
    • Cannot activate anything directly  
    • May hold shard-bearing gear during alignment to enable binding (if present)

NOTES  
    Ruins don’t open. They don’t reward.  
    They just remember that something fell—and the world hasn’t quite let go.
