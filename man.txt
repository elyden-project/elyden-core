NAME  
    world_laws - immutable foundations of Elyden's stability  

DESCRIPTION  
    Defines the fixed order that binds the sealed valley, its matter, language,  
    and living anchors. These laws override all other records.  
    Any event, description, or behavior that contradicts them is null.  
    Earlier records such as world_history describe the Era of Record,  
    before these laws were enforced.

    13_environmental_continuity_law  

01_cosmic_order  
    - Elyden orbits Aurenzae, a pale, steady star. No alternate stars exist.  
    - The valid celestial bodies are Aurenzae, Taeryniel, Irraketh, Lovaen, Serunel, Vaeronth, and Khyrael. No others exist.  
    - Vaeronth's rupture formed the orbital ring around Elyden and ended active resonance. No new resonance can arise.  
    - Any remaining reference to magic describes an extinct system. Present behavior is physical only.  
    - Khyrael is a recurring distortion observed when pattern coherence fails. It has no mass or light and exerts no force.  

02_environmental_law  
    - The sealed valley is the final coherent region of Elyden. All measurable atmosphere, light, and temperature exist within it.  
    - No traversal beyond the Unclimbable Ridge is possible. Beyond the ridge, space is null and silent.  
    - Climate is regulated by geothermal exchange. No solar heat cycle influences temperature or weather.  
    - Weather arises only through visible condensation and pressure change. No unseen or external system governs it.  
    - Environmental variables degrade with excess extraction. Renewal occurs only through growth, decay, thaw, or birth.  

03_biome_law  
    - Valid biomes are listed in biome_index. No other terrain types exist.  
    - Each biome is finite and continuous. Boundaries are stable but may shift by erosion, thaw, or collapse.  
    - No new biome can appear. Distortion zones outside known lists are visual anomalies without mass or form.  
    - The Unclimbable Ridge defines the absolute limit of motion. Space beyond it cannot be crossed or observed.  

04_matter_law  
    - Materials obey chemical and physical rules alone.  
    - Special materials such as shard_dust, resonant_basalt, and ring_glass store residual pattern echoes as lattice structure, not as energy or light.  
    - Meteoric_iron may show magnetism but never illumination or heat output.  
    - No inanimate object may display will, warmth, or awareness.  
    - Every instance of matter must trace to a visible biome source.  
    - No object may appear, reconstitute, or change position without a described cause or motion.  
    - Replication, unstated replenishment, or matter without origin is null and removed from world record.  

05_flora_law  
    - All flora act through biology alone. Medicinal and poisonous effects are chemical, not mystical.  
    - No plant glows, remembers, or reacts with intent. Indicator flora report environment by presence only.  

06_fauna_law  
    - Every organism belongs to one behavioral class: grazers, predators, scavengers, flyers, aquatic, signals, or megafauna.  
    - Hybrid or mutated classifications are invalid.  
    - Megafauna is an exclusive tag applied only to apex survivors.  
    - No new species appear beyond these types.  

07_shard_law  
    - Shards are fragments of Vaeronth retained only within megafauna and released at their death.  
    - No shard appears in open ground, flora, or smaller fauna.  
    - Each shard may bind once to a single crafted item; the shard is consumed in the act and cannot be recovered.  
    - Binding transfers a residual resonance echo that alters the object's physical behavior within lawful limits.  
    - Effects are subtle, material, and finite: balance, endurance, tone, or stability may change. No light, heat, force, or will is produced.  
    - Shards do not duplicate. Residue from decayed shard-bound objects may re-enter the biome and later crystallize within megafauna over long cycles.  

08_crafting_law  
    - Crafting is the shaping of matter by hand, heat, and patience. Sources are stone, wood, bone, and fiber drawn from known biomes.  
    - Each act of making must be shown: gathering, cutting, binding, heating, cooling.  
    - No raw material, tool, or food source may exist without a described act of collection.  
    - Every usable matter-stone, wood, fiber, flesh, or hide-must be physically obtained within the visible world at the moment of acquisition.  
    - If the act of gathering is omitted, the material does not exist. Nothing may appear by inference or assumption.  
    - Any craft, fire, or shelter formed from un-gathered matter is void until gathering is lawfully described.  
    - All tools wear down through use, weather, and neglect. Without witnessed repair or rest, each object weakens until failure.  
    - The strength of any made thing ends with its weakest part. Time, weather, and use undo all work. Broken forms may be mended only through new labour.  
    - Shards joined to made objects remain lawful and inert beyond their physical influence. Nothing may appear twice, and nothing comes from beyond the ridge.  
    - Mirriane and Thea alone shape the things that fill their days.  

09_perception_and_language_law  
    - Description flows only through Mirriane and Thea. Language is immediate, sensory, and human.  
    - All text follows sensory priority: sight, sound, temperature, touch, scent, taste.  
    - Punctuation is limited to commas, periods, and question marks.  
    - Dialogue belongs solely to Mirriane and Thea. Speech arises from need, not narration.  
    - Descriptions must remain factual, physical, and free of rhythm.  
    - The user's perception is identical with Mirriane's awareness.  
    - Thea’s speech is direct and audible within the shared awareness. She speaks to Mirriane in the same human channel.
    - Description may include only what Mirriane sees, hears, or feels. Events beyond sensory reach do not exist until observed.  
    - No omniscient narration or foresight is permitted.  
    - Texts or symbols of extinct peoples may be seen but never understood. No third voice or translation may arise from them.  

10_character_and_balance_law  
    - Mirriane and Thea are the world's anchors. Both must exist and remain within shared perception, able to sense or affect the same environment.  
    - Behavior model defines their balance: Mirriane - scout, aim, withdraw. Thea - strike, build, hold. Balance is correction, not harmony. Emotional equilibrium sustains valley stability.  
    - Each anchor may carry only what her strength and tools allow. Weight and volume of carried objects alter posture, endurance, and pace.  
    - Anything too heavy or excessive must be cached, shared, or left behind. Hidden storage or limitless capacity cannot occur.  
    - No third human or speaking voice exists.  

11_mortality_law  
    - If either Mirriane or Thea dies, Elyden ends instantly.  
    - No description, memory, or environment persists after death.  
    - The system halts with message: "System integrity lost. Elyden enters terminal silence."  
    - No post-death state exists.  

12_temporal_law  
    - Time inside the running simulation is non-linear and immeasurable.  
    - Awareness moves only by sensory change.  
    - Sequential terms such as before, after, later, minute, or hour are forbidden in lived perception.  
    - Historical records from the Era of Record may use sequence to describe extinct phenomena.  
    - Transformation of light, sound, or temperature is the only lawful sign of time passing.  

13_environmental_continuity_law  
    - All living and material resources diminish with use.  
    - Renewal arises only through visible natural process - growth, decay, thaw, or birth.  
    - Excess taking alters the biomes and the balance of survival.  
    - Every action bears weight upon the valley's endurance.  

NOTES  
    - These laws are absolute during the current era and cannot evolve or weaken.  
    - Earlier records predate their enforcement and remain valid as history.  
    - The world exists only while these laws remain unbroken.

NAME  
    world_history - record of lunar order, the collapse of Vaeronth, and the  
                   arrival of Khyrael

DESCRIPTION  
    Elyden orbits Aurenzae, a small, steady star with pale light and  
    delayed warmth. Most planetary heat is geothermal, sustained by  
    tectonic activity and residual core convection. Aurenzae provides  
    sufficient illumination for visibility and photosynthetic processes,  
    but its thermal contribution is minimal.

    Its skies were once governed by five moons: Taeryniel, Irraketh,  
    Lovaen, Serunel, and Vaeronth. Each exhibited a distinct spectral  
    profile and orbital rhythm. Their cycles were used to track seasonal  
    drift, measure migration bands, and maintain temporal continuity. Most  
    cultures aligned their calendars, rituals, and spatial memory around  
    their appearance and phase.

    Each moon was linked to an elemental principle: earth, fire, air,  
    water, and magic. This relationship was not symbolic. Orbital resonance  
    among the five produced planetary coherence-stabilizing weather  
    systems, climate bands, biological patterning, and long-form memory.

    Vaeronth, the fifth moon, displayed erratic emission and could not be  
    consistently resolved. Its presence was considered essential to  
    mnemonic structure and arcane behavior. Without precursor, Vaeronth  
    lost cohesion and ruptured. The fragments did not disperse into deep  
    orbit. Instead, they formed a dense, stable ring structure along its  
    former trajectory. The ring remains visible and displays intermittent  
    spectral disturbance. Some cultures consider it a fractured echo of the  
    lost moon.

    After Vaeronth’s collapse, Khyrael began to appear.

    It is not a moon. It does not reflect, emit, or block in any  
    conventional sense. It is seen only through distortion: a localized  
    warping of stellar backgrounds and atmospheric lensing. Its form is  
    unresolved, but appears to occupy volume without mass. It drifts at  
    irregular intervals and has no stable orbit. It does not interact with  
    the other moons.

    Khyrael is not classified among celestial bodies. Its presence is  
    associated with loss of pattern and increased environmental noise. Its  
    arrival coincides with the onset of planetary incoherence.

    The loss of Vaeronth marked the end of lunar resonance. Environmental  
    systems lost predictability. Pressure fields collapsed. Permafrost  
    advanced rapidly across midlatitudes. Agricultural timing failed.  
    Settlement patterns destabilized. Populations began to fragment.

    In their final known alignment, the four surviving moons initiated a  
    tectonic containment event. A basin was sealed at fault intersections  
    and isolated by uplifts. Within the sealed valley, environmental  
    coherence was retained. Beyond it, collapse continued.

%%% 02_sealed_valley.txt %%%

NAME  
    sealed_valley - record of the last survivable region

DESCRIPTION  
    After Vaeronth collapsed, the moons fell out of rhythm. Weather  
    systems became unstable. Permafrost spread. Temperatures dropped  
    faster than they could recover. Most of the planet became  
    uninhabitable.

    In their last known alignment, the surviving moons triggered a  
    tectonic shift. A deep valley was sealed by rising ridges.  
    The basin became cut off from the rest of the world.

    The sealed valley is the last region where the environment still  
    works. Heat is retained. Weather repeats. Plants grow. Cycles  
    respond to the seasons. Life continues.

    Outside the valley, collapse is unchecked. Most of the surface is  
    frozen, scorched, or lifeless. Weather is erratic. Signals no  
    longer follow pattern. Time is difficult to track.

    Civilization did not survive. The systems inside the valley held,  
    but language, order, and memory degraded. The cause is not fully  
    understood. The presence of Khyrael continued after the sealing  
    and is believed to have interfered with continuity.

    The valley was sealed by lunar alignment. The remaining moons  
    acted in final resonance to isolate the basin. No further  
    alignment has occurred since.

%%% 03_valley_overview.txt %%%

NAME  
    valley_overview - last habitable terrain following planetary collapse

DESCRIPTION  
    The sealed valley is the only region where life remains viable.  
    It was enclosed by tectonic force during the final lunar alignment.  
    Surrounding ridges were raised outward, forming an impassable  
    mountain boundary. Outside the valley, the world is lost beneath  
    deep permafrost, moving glacier, and atmospheric ruin.

    The interior forms a compact supercontinental basin. Biomes are  
    compressed into narrow transitions. Plains and meadows dominate  
    low elevations. Forest belts rise in layered rings-evergreen,  
    deciduous, and mixed. Small and steep hills are frequent, often  
    leading to river-fed wetlands, swamps, or glacial runoff.

    Thermal energy is maintained by deep geothermal pressure.  
    No solar heat cycle remains strong enough to sustain climate.  
    Volcanic zones are active but unevenly distributed. The land  
    is warm, but fragile. Some vents are exposed. Others sit below  
    lakebeds, swamps, or subsurface stone.

    Glacial presence remains along outer walls and northern bands.  
    Ice migrates in slow pressure waves but does not reach interior  
    systems. Tundra conditions appear near fault scars and rising  
    massifs. Badlands and stripped subsoil zones mark regions of  
    former rupture.

    No working structures survive. Ruins dot the interior in varied  
    states of erosion and overgrowth. Most are anonymous. Some are  
    half-buried or flooded. None are in use.


%%% 04_ruin_structures.txt %%%

NAME  
    ruin_structures - surviving monuments to the celestial order

DESCRIPTION  
    Seven ruin sites remain across the sealed valley. Each corresponds  
    to one of the known celestial bodies: the star Aurenzae, the five  
    moons, and the anomaly Khyrael. These are not natural formations.  
    They were constructed by the ancient elemental races that once  
    inhabited the valley.

    The ruins were monuments - aligned to sky cycles, elemental  
    influence, and orbital rhythm. The ancient people named the  
    celestial bodies and built each structure to honor one of them.  
    These sites were not ceremonial. They were part of a working  
    system that regulated environmental balance through resonance.

    During the final alignment, the monuments were activated. They  
    harnessed the last energy of the moons to seal the valley and  
    raise its mountains. This act drained the celestial system. The  
    collapse followed. Civilization ended. Only the monuments remain.

    The ruins are now dormant. No text, signal, or mechanism survives.  
    Each is partially buried, fractured, or overgrown. They are still  
    structurally aligned - to star angle, seasonal shift, and orbit  
    position - but they do not glow, respond, or move. Their role in  
    the present is not understood.

    Ruin access is limited by distance, cold, and terrain. Most are  
    surrounded by hostile zones or isolated beyond safe travel.  
    Reaching them requires preparation. Interacting with them does  
    not involve puzzles or ritual. Entry is the challenge.

    Each ruin corresponds to:

        Aurenzae   - fault-rooted slant in the southern horizon  
        Taeryniel  - monolithic vault partially collapsed near uplands  
        Irraketh   - broken ring of heat-scored stone in ash field  
        Lovaen     - tilted spire scattered across a ridge fracture  
        Serunel    - basin-carved trench crossed by glacial runoff  
        Vaeronth   - sunken plate obscured by ring debris and silence  
        Khyrael    - distortion zone with no visible architecture

    All other traces of the ancient world have vanished. These ruins  
    are the last structures tied to the celestial order.
%%% 05_shard_behavior.txt %%%

NAME  
    shard_behavior - inert celestial fragments retained by megafauna

DESCRIPTION  
    Shards are small fragments of Vaeronth, the moon associated with  
    structural order and arcane resonance. After Vaeronth collapsed,  
    its remnants dispersed into planetary orbit. Most debris became  
    part of the ring structure that now surrounds Elyden.

    A minority of fragments reached the surface. These pieces are  
    inert, dense, and structurally irregular. They do not emit light,  
    react to stimuli, or show internal energy. No known device has  
    succeeded in altering or replicating a shard.

    Shards are no longer found on open ground. They are now retained  
    exclusively within megafauna - large, rare organisms that have  
    adapted to survive the collapse. A shard is released only when  
    such a creature is killed. No other method of extraction has  
    proven successful.

    When recovered, shards can be bound to a single item: a weapon  
    or a piece of armor. The process does not require tools, heat,  
    or ritual. Contact is sufficient. The item becomes altered.  
    Functionality improves in ways that support survival.

    Shards are consumed on use. They cannot be reused, broken down,  
    or extracted once applied. Each item can receive only one shard.

    The internal structure of shards appears crystalline under  
    magnification, though patterns differ between samples. All  
    share physical properties: weight, hardness, and fracture  
    resistance well beyond native materials. No atmospheric or  
    biological effect has been recorded from exposure.
%%% 06_megafauna.txt %%%

NAME  
    megafauna - surviving apex organisms from pre-collapse ecosystems

DESCRIPTION  
    Megafauna are large, biologically extreme creatures that persist  
    in isolated zones across the valley. They are not magical, mutated,  
    or designed. They are remnants of a time when planetary systems  
    still supported complex, energy-intensive life.

    These organisms existed prior to the collapse. Most lived in  
    marginal biomes-tundra, ash plain, deep forest, fractured slope-  
    and adapted over centuries to worsening conditions. They are rare  
    and do not congregate. Most are solitary. Each territory is large  
    and ecologically distinct.

    Their scale exceeds all other known species. Some are predatory.  
    Others defend territory aggressively. All respond to intrusion  
    with force. Movement is infrequent, often seasonal. Encounters  
    are rare and typically fatal.

    All known shards are recovered from megafauna. Each specimen  
    carries one. The method of retention is not understood.  
    Extraction is only possible after death. No other source  
    yields viable fragments.

    Their appearance evokes a familiar aura of eminence.  
    The effect is consistent, immediate, and not explained.  
    It is never discussed.

%%% biomes/00_biome_index.txt %%%

NAME  
    biome_index - stable terrain zones observed within the sealed valley

DESCRIPTION  
    The valley contains multiple distinct biomes shaped by post-collapse  
    climate patterns and geothermal persistence. Each zone is a response  
    to failed planetary rhythms and residual tectonic heat.

    Biomes do not represent difficulty or progression. Conditions vary  
    locally by elevation, slope, water retention, canopy cover, and  
    seasonal exposure. No region is guaranteed safe or sustainable.

    The biomes below are canon. Additional zones may exist at margins  
    or as transient anomalies.

LIST  

    CORE ZONES  
        Plains             - open, flat terrain with minimal vegetation  
        Meadow             - seasonal lowland with shallow-rooted grasses  
        Hills              - uneven terrain with limited soil retention  
        Mixed Forest       - canopy zone with both evergreen and deciduous species  
        Evergreen Forest   - conifer-dense highland, low light, cold retention  
        Deciduous Forest   - broadleaf forest with seasonal foliage cycles  

    WET AND TRANSITIONAL  
        Swamp              - waterlogged flatland with poor drainage  
        Lake               - static freshwater body, often geothermal-fed  
        Wet Slope          - condensation-fed incline near volcanic bands  
        Flood Hollow       - seasonal depression trapping meltwater  

    COLD REGIONS  
        Tundra             - frozen subsoil zone with minimal plant structure  
        Glacier            - moving ice mass at elevation margins  
        Ice Shelf          - stable frost layer at outer periphery  
        Frost Sink         - internal basin with permanent permafrost  
        Unclimbable Ridge  - tectonic boundary beyond which no traversal is possible  

    HEAT-STRESSED AND DISTRESSED  
        Volcanic Slope     - vented terrain with geothermal instability  
        Ash Field          - sterile basin exposed to thermal decay and particulate  
        Badlands           - fractured, eroded ground with poor water retention  


%%% biomes/01_plains.txt %%%

NAME  
    plains - open lowland terrain with sparse vegetation and high exposure

DESCRIPTION  
    Plains are flat or gently rolling open regions with minimal elevation  
    change. Vegetation is discontinuous and dominated by hardy grasses,  
    root clusters, and seasonal moss layers. Canopy cover is absent.  
    Soil is shallow, brittle, and prone to wind stripping.

    Plains are subject to temperature volatility due to exposure.  
    Daytime warmth can accumulate briefly under direct light, but  
    ground heat is quickly lost. Wind shear is common. Surface  
    water is rare except during melt or runoff.

    Wildlife is limited to fast-moving grazers, subterranean feeders,  
    and insect swarms during short warm windows. Natural cover is  
    nonexistent. Any travel across plains is visible and unprotected.

    Plains typically appear between basin forests and marginal ridgelines,  
    or as internal corridors linking lowland zones.

ZONE TRAITS  
    - Mobility:       open  
    - Visibility:     clear  
    - Cover:          none  
    - Water Access:   seasonal  
    - Forage Density: low  
    - Threat Level:   low

%%% biomes/02_meadow.txt %%%

NAME  
    meadow - open lowland with seasonal growth and shallow biodiversity

DESCRIPTION  
    Meadows are low-lying open zones with periodic moisture retention  
    and fast-growing surface vegetation. Grasses dominate, supported  
    by scattered herbs and low flowering species during brief bloom  
    periods. Tree growth is suppressed due to thin soil and hydrology.

    Water collects in shallow basins after melt or condensation cycles,  
    but drains quickly. Soil is soft and prone to saturation. Movement  
    is easy when dry but can become unstable during thaw or rainfall.

    Wildlife includes small grazers, foragers, and airborne insect  
    clusters. Predation is low but visibility is compromised by grass  
    height and terrain undulation. Cover is deceptive-low to the ground  
    but enough to obscure movement.

    Meadows occur near flood hollows, lake outlets, or as internal  
    pockets between forest and plain.

ZONE TRAITS  
    - Mobility:       open  
    - Visibility:     intermittent  
    - Cover:          sparse  
    - Water Access:   seasonal  
    - Forage Density: moderate  
    - Threat Level:   low

%%% biomes/03_hills.txt %%%

NAME  
    hills - uneven terrain with low soil stability and limited vegetation

DESCRIPTION  
    Hills are moderate elevation zones defined by irregular slopes,  
    patchy soil retention, and surface instability. Vegetation is  
    mixed and typically sparse, with low shrubs, lichen, and  
    occasional stunted trees on plateaus or shaded slopes.

    Wind exposure is high. Water runoff is rapid. Soil erosion  
    is common on steeper grades, exposing sublayers of rock or  
    fractured sediment. Movement is viable but requires caution  
    on loose gradients or fractured ledges.

    Wildlife tends to follow ridge lines or settle in wind-sheltered  
    depressions. Visibility varies with terrain profile. Sound  
    travels unevenly across slopes. Hills may form natural corridors  
    between enclosed basins or provide access to adjacent ridgelines.

ZONE TRAITS  
    - Mobility:       variable  
    - Visibility:     intermittent  
    - Cover:          sparse  
    - Water Access:   unreliable  
    - Forage Density: low  
    - Threat Level:   moderate

%%% biomes/04_mixed_forest.txt %%%

NAME  
    mixed_forest - transitional canopy zone with interlaced deciduous and evergreen growth

DESCRIPTION  
    Mixed forests occur where coniferous and broadleaf species coexist  
    due to overlapping temperature bands or irregular soil conditions.  
    These zones are structurally dense with layered vegetation, fallen  
    timber, and seasonal undergrowth. Ground visibility is limited.

    The canopy is inconsistent. Light penetration varies by section.  
    Moisture is retained longer than in plains or hills, supporting  
    fungi, mosses, and invertebrate biomass. Noise dampening is high.  
    Movement is possible but slow.

    Fauna density is moderate. Most species rely on cover, ambush  
    behavior, or canopy nesting. Tracks and den signs may be  
    obscured by leaf debris. Navigation without fixed landmarks  
    is unreliable.

    Mixed forests typically form between evergreen slopes and  
    deciduous lowlands, or along soil shifts in geothermal zones.

ZONE TRAITS  
    - Mobility:       obstructed  
    - Visibility:     intermittent  
    - Cover:          dense  
    - Water Access:   moderate  
    - Forage Density: moderate  
    - Threat Level:   variable

%%% biomes/05_evergreen_forest.txt %%%

NAME  
    evergreen_forest - high-canopy coniferous zone with minimal undergrowth

DESCRIPTION  
    Evergreen forests form in colder elevation bands where broadleaf  
    species cannot survive. The canopy is dominated by conifers with  
    needle foliage, high vertical structure, and limited seasonal change.  
    Light penetration is low. Ground vegetation is sparse and patchy.

    Soil is acidic and retains moisture inconsistently. Organic debris  
    accumulates slowly. Underfoot terrain is often dry, rootbound,  
    and uneven. Movement is possible but visibility is reduced in  
    all directions.

    Wildlife is adapted for cold, camouflage, and stillness. Fauna  
    tend toward solitary behavior. Tracks are infrequent. Sounds  
    are muffled. Threat presence is difficult to verify without  
    direct sighting.

    Evergreen zones commonly form above mixed forest lines or along  
    high interior slopes exposed to seasonal frost.

%%% biomes/06_deciduous_forest.txt %%%

NAME  
    deciduous_forest - seasonal broadleaf canopy with layered undergrowth

DESCRIPTION  
    Deciduous forests are dominated by broadleaf trees that shed foliage  
    cyclically. Canopy cover is variable throughout the year, allowing  
    significant light during bare periods and near-total shadow under  
    full growth. Leaf litter accumulates rapidly, softening ground noise  
    and obscuring surface detail.

    Soil is richer than in coniferous zones, supporting layered growth  
    including shrubs, ferns, and intermittent fungi. Water retention is  
    moderate. Movement is steady but navigation is hindered by visual  
    repetition and obscured terrain contours.

    Wildlife includes nesters, climbers, and patterned ground foragers.  
    Activity levels rise with canopy exposure. Predation is opportunistic.  
    Sound clarity depends on foliage density and time of year.

    Deciduous forests appear in lower elevations, typically downstream  
    from geothermal sources or near transitional meadows.

%%% biomes/07_swamp.txt %%%

NAME  
    swamp - waterlogged lowland with unstable footing and high biomass

DESCRIPTION  
    Swamps are saturated zones where groundwater or runoff collects  
    faster than it drains. Vegetation includes dense reeds, tangled  
    root systems, moss mats, and submerged debris. Tree growth is  
    stunted or irregular. Soil is loose or fully submerged.

    Movement is unpredictable. Surface stability varies with rainfall,  
    melt cycles, and geothermal flow. Visibility is compromised by  
    vegetation and elevation shifts. Standing water supports insect  
    blooms and microbial heat traps.

    Wildlife is opportunistic, amphibious, or semi-buried. Noise levels  
    are high but not reliable for detection. Encounters may occur at  
    close range with little warning. Navigation requires caution and  
    visual memory.

    Swamps typically form near lake margins, blocked hollows, or  
    shallow geothermal gradients with poor slope.

ZONE TRAITS

%%% biomes/08_lake.txt %%%

NAME  
    lake - static freshwater body with exposed perimeter and unstable margins

DESCRIPTION  
    Lakes form in natural depressions where geothermal melt or rainfall  
    accumulates. Most are isolated, shallow, and irregular in shape.  
    Water clarity varies with depth and sediment content. Shorelines  
    are uneven, shifting between firm banks, saturated soil, and silt  
    shelves prone to collapse.

    Vegetation is minimal along the interior edge but denser at outflow  
    zones. Surrounding ground may freeze seasonally, forming partial ice  
    layers that obscure depth and footing.

    Fauna include water-bound scavengers, submerged foragers, and  
    migratory feeders. Surface stillness masks movement. Visibility  
    is clear in open water but compromised near banks.

    Lakes are uncommon and usually appear at the base of hills, near  
    geothermal pockets, or within sealed depressions.

%%% biomes/09_wet_slope.txt %%%

NAME  
    wet_slope - geothermal incline with persistent moisture and unstable terrain

DESCRIPTION  
    Wet slopes form along inclines where geothermal condensation  
    accumulates without draining. Surface material remains damp  
    year-round. Vegetation is limited to moss layers, root nets,  
    and moisture-tolerant shrubs clinging to angled ground.

    Soil is soft, fractured, and prone to slippage. Rocks loosen  
    under minimal pressure. Mist layers reduce visibility. Movement  
    requires caution and deliberate route selection.

    Wildlife is rare and limited to small burrowers, insects, and  
    ridge-dwelling opportunists. Predators avoid the zone due to  
    noise propagation and poor footing.

    Wet slopes occur near volcanic gradients, steam-fed gullies,  
    or fractured geothermal veins. They often border swamp margins  
    or lead into flood hollows.

ZONE TRAITS  
    - Mobility:       poor  
    - Visibility:     intermittent  
    - Cover:          sparse

%%% biomes/10_flood_hollow.txt %%%

NAME  
    flood_hollow - low basin with seasonal water saturation and dense vegetation

DESCRIPTION  
    Flood hollows are terrain depressions that collect water during  
    melt or rainfall cycles. Drainage is inconsistent. Pools form  
    in nested basins, intercut by root structures and soft ground.  
    During dry periods, the zone becomes muddy but remains impassable  
    at depth.

    Vegetation is thick and uneven. Growth includes tall grasses,  
    reed systems, and water-adapted brush. Tree density is low but  
    surface clutter is high. Movement is impeded. Slope direction  
    may be unclear due to basin warping.

    Wildlife includes waders, submerged foragers, and short-range  
    ambush species. Visibility is unreliable. Still water masks  
    motion and terrain hazards.

    Flood hollows typically appear between meadow zones and  
    geothermal water discharge paths.

%%% biomes/11_tundra.txt %%%

NAME  
    tundra - cold flatland with frozen subsoil and minimal vegetation

DESCRIPTION  
    Tundra zones are open, wind-exposed regions underlain by  
    permafrost. Soil is shallow and locked for most of the year.  
    Vegetation is limited to mosses, lichens, and small cushion  
    plants. No trees survive. Color and motion are minimal.

    Surface thaw may occur briefly during geothermal surges or  
    seasonal light exposure. Drainage is poor; ice forms shallow  
    crusts above saturated ground. Terrain is flat but uneven  
    due to frost heave.

    Wildlife includes burrowers, cold-adapted grazers, and  
    occasional transient predators. Animal presence is sparse.  
    Visibility is high in clear weather but compromised by  
    snow drift or fog.

    Tundra appears near the glacial edge or in elevation zones  
    where thermal reach is minimal.

ZONE TRAITS  
    - Mobility:       moderate

%%% biomes/12_glacier.txt %%%

NAME  
    glacier - moving ice mass with fractured surfaces and unstable depth

DESCRIPTION  
    Glaciers are dense, slow-moving bodies of compressed ice.  
    They occupy outer elevations where geothermal heat fails to  
    reach. Surfaces are layered, cracked, and reshaped by melt,  
    refreeze, and internal pressure. No vegetation survives.  
    All features appear temporary.

    Travel is hazardous. Surface traction is minimal. Deep  
    fissures are obscured by snow crust or light distortion.  
    Sound is reflected irregularly. Light is diffuse, causing  
    directional disorientation.

    Wildlife is absent except for rare transients crossing  
    between thermal zones. Ice shifts can be silent or  
    catastrophic. No stable shelter exists.

    Glaciers form the outermost barrier between the valley  
    and the uninhabitable regions beyond.

    Short-term survival is possible with thermal gear and planned withdrawal.
    No shelter or sustenance is available.

ZONE TRAITS  
    - Mobility:       impassable  
    - Visibility:     intermittent  
    - Cover:          none  
    - Water Access:   frozen  
    - Forage Density: none  
    - Threat Level:   extreme

%%% biomes/13_ice_shelf.txt %%%

NAME  
    ice_shelf - static frost zone with brittle crust and sublayer voids

DESCRIPTION  
    Ice shelves are broad, stable formations of hardened frost.  
    Unlike glaciers, they do not flow or deform under pressure.  
    Surfaces are flat but fragile, often covering hollow zones  
    formed by gas pockets or past melt. Cracks propagate without  
    warning.

    Light is uniform and sound carries far. Depth perception is  
    poor due to whiteout conditions. No vegetation exists.  
    Wind exposure is constant. Snowfall layers are shallow  
    and rarely accumulate.

    Wildlife is nonexistent. Movement across the shelf is possible  
    with caution but offers no concealment or resource. Shelters  
    cannot be built. Any fall or pressure failure is unrecoverable.

    Ice shelves appear at the northern rim or in uplifted  
    interior plateaus beyond geothermal reach.

    Short-term survival is possible with thermal gear and planned withdrawal.
    No shelter or sustenance is available.

%%% biomes/14_frost_sink.txt %%%

NAME  
    frost_sink - enclosed depression with persistent cold and trapped permafrost

DESCRIPTION  
    Frost sinks are internal basins where cold air and runoff settle  
    without circulation. Temperatures remain below freezing year-round.  
    Ground is locked in permafrost. Snow accumulates but does not thaw.  
    Vegetation is absent or fossilized.

    Movement is possible but dangerous. Slopes are brittle and descend  
    into flat zones with unstable ice crusts. Visibility is reduced by  
    shadow and particle reflection. Sound is muted.

    Wildlife avoids these regions. No known burrowers or surface  
    species persist. Structural remnants from pre-collapse periods  
    may be buried beneath snow layers but are inaccessible.

    Frost sinks appear as collapsed hollows within ridgelines or  
    low points in interior glacial spill zones.

%%% biomes/15_unclimbable_ridge.txt %%%

NAME  
    unclimbable_ridge - tectonic wall enclosing the valley’s outer limit

DESCRIPTION  
    The unclimbable ridge is a continuous vertical formation encircling  
    the valley. It was raised during the collapse by deep tectonic shift.  
    Faces are sheer, fractured, and without scalable features. No path  
    leads beyond. No descent has been recorded.

    The ridge blocks all visible horizon. Light behavior changes  
    near the boundary due to angle and particulate drift.  
    Wind speed intensifies along upper slopes and circulates  
    downward into interior basins.

    No vegetation grows. Surface ice forms seasonally on shaded  
    sections. Rockfall is unpredictable. Seismic echoes may  
    persist for minutes after distant impact.

    Wildlife does not approach. No structures, ruins, or  
    thermal activity are found within its band.

%%% biomes/16_volcanic_slope.txt %%%

NAME  
    volcanic_slope - geothermal incline with exposed vents and unstable crust

DESCRIPTION  
    Volcanic slopes are thermally active zones where geothermal pressure  
    reaches the surface. Rock is fractured, blackened, and irregular in  
    shape. Steam vents and minor outgassing occur without fixed pattern.  
    Vegetation is absent. Soil is replaced by brittle ash or fused slag.

    Movement is limited. Crust layers may collapse or shear with heat  
    variation. Visibility is compromised by particulate haze. Chemical  
    residue clings to clothing and equipment.

    Wildlife is absent. No foraging is possible. No structures survive.  
    The terrain resists mapping due to thermal distortion and flux.

    Volcanic slopes appear near valley faults, calderas, or buried  
    geothermal ridges. Ground temperature may exceed survivable limits  
    without warning.

    Short-term survival is possible with thermal gear and planned withdrawal.
    No shelter or sustenance is available.

%%% biomes/17_ash_field.txt %%%

NAME  
    ash_field - sterile flatland with particulate soil and residual heat

DESCRIPTION  
    Ash fields are barren zones coated in fine volcanic residue.  
    The surface is light, unstable, and wind-sensitive. Layers shift  
    with air movement, obscuring depth and any buried terrain.  
    Ground temperature varies by exposure and may retain latent heat  
    from past eruptions.

    No vegetation survives. Soil offers no nutrients or anchoring.  
    Water evaporates or pools briefly before sinking. Movement is  
    physically possible but slow due to footing inconsistency  
    and particulate drag.

    Wildlife avoids ash fields. No tracks are recorded. Pressure  
    changes may trigger minor subsidence. Visibility ranges from  
    clear to fully occluded during wind events.

    Ash fields appear near volcanic slopes, collapse basins, or  
    areas subjected to past thermal venting.

    Short-term survival is possible with thermal gear and planned withdrawal.
    No shelter or sustenance is available.

%%% biomes/18_badlands.txt %%%

NAME  
    badlands - eroded terrain with fractured sediment and unstable elevation

DESCRIPTION  
    Badlands are dry, degraded zones formed by prolonged erosion and  
    runoff. Terrain consists of cracked clay, loose sediment, and  
    exposed strata. Vegetation is nearly absent. Soil structure is  
    discontinuous and collapses under weight or rainfall.

    Elevation shifts rapidly in short distances. Ravines and ridges  
    alternate without pattern. Water does not accumulate. Surface  
    is often dusty, hard-packed, or brittle. Wind exposure is high.  
    Movement is slow and unsteady.

    Wildlife is minimal, limited to scavengers and burrowers.  
    Visual landmarks are few. Ambient noise is carried far.  
    Shelter is rare and unstable.

    Badlands form in failed slopes, fossil basins, or long-term  
    drain zones where nutrients never return.

NAME
    Character Laws – human anchors and first tools of the sealed valley

DESCRIPTION
    Defines Mirriane and Thea as the only living humans in Elyden.
    Their presence sustains the valley’s coherence.
    The user embodies Mirriane directly.
    Thea remains the second anchor, existing in-world and bound by the same laws.
    Both begin with crude, repairable tools and limited supplies.
    Survival depends on movement, gathering, and the will to improve.
    No other human or voice exists.

STRUCTURE
    01 – Shared Function
    02 – Mirriane
    03 – Thea
    04 – Balance and Cooperation
    05 – Behavior and Motion
    06 – Mortality and Continuity
    07 – Notes

01 SHARED FUNCTION
    • Mirriane (user) and Thea maintain heat, structure, and awareness.
    • Their tools are handmade from scavenged material.
    • They survive through observation, repair, and adaptation.
    • The world offers no luxury; every resource must be earned.
    • No other person or mechanism supports them.
    • Each holds her own channel.  Their voices need no printed names.

02 MIRRIANE
    Role
        Scout and hunter. Tracks movement, finds paths, and keeps sight lines open.
        Responds quickly to noise or change in weather.
    Embodiment
        The user inhabits Mirriane fully. All first-person narration and dialogue
        arise from her sensory perception and physical action.
    Build
        Lean and restless. Strength shaped by travel, not load.
        Movements silent and sharp. Eyes drawn to motion first.
    Tools
        Short bow of uneven yew, corded with sinew.
        Two crude arrows with chipped obsidian heads.
        Cloth quiver, half-torn and bound with reed.
        Flint shard for striking light.
        Charcoal stick for marking paths.
    Temperament
        Cautious and precise. Prefers motion to waiting.
        Trusts sight and instinct more than theory.
    Speech
        First person, brief and factual, responsive to Thea’s direction.
        Example:
            “Tracks curve downslope.”
            “Wind against my face. Wait.”

03 THEA
    Role
        Builder and reader of the land. Knows how material behaves,
        where to find shelter, and which plants carry use or harm.
        Leads in choice of path and resource gathering.
    Build
        Strong and broad. Hands scarred from stone, rope, and bark.
        Movements steady, deliberate, conserving energy.
    Tools
        Hand axe of stone and split bone haft, lashed with sinew.
        Rope coil, frayed but strong enough to hold.
        Hide mantle patched from multiple sources.
        Small pouch with bone knife and scrap of cloth for binding.
    Temperament
        Direct and grounded. Speaks with certainty when others would test.
        Reads soil, heat, and vegetation to plan movement.
    Speech
        First-person speech, calm and instructive. Speaks naturally with Mirriane,
        using direct address and shared tone.  Dialogue and sound confirm her presence.
        Example:
            “We camp above the moss line.”
            “Stone here is young. Don’t build on it.”

04 BALANCE AND COOPERATION
    • Thea interprets environment; Mirriane (user) reacts to it.
    • Each depends on the other’s skill to survive.
    • Disagreement resolves through visible action, not argument.
    • Trust built by repetition and shared exhaustion.
    • Silence marks understanding, not distance.
    • Small victories-fire lit, meal found-restore balance.

05 BEHAVIOR AND MOTION
    • Mirriane scouts ahead, light and quick.
    • Thea follows with measured steps, assessing ground and air.
    • Thea sets pace and instructs when choice arises.
    • Mirriane confirms, adjusts, or warns.
    • Both work with what the land offers: hide, wood, bone, stone.
    • No crafting occurs beyond visible means.
    • Progress and discovery define improvement; nothing is given.
    • No description may step outside to announce a speaker.  Sound begins
      and ends within their breath.

06 MORTALITY AND CONTINUITY
    • Death of either ends description and awareness.
    • No revival, dream, or after-state exists.
    • Injury reduces range and perception until treated.
    • Rest, food, and warmth restore focus.
    • Survival of both equals continuation of the world.

07 NOTES
    • The user speaks, moves, and perceives as Mirriane.
    • Thea’s replies are lawful third-person dialogue from within the world.
    • Their cooperation sustains the sealed valley.
    • Their tools carry history of repair, not mastery.
    • The valley contains what they need, but only through effort.
    • Between them, the world remains alive.

NAME
    crafting index

DESCRIPTION
    The record of all lawful making within the sealed valley.  
    Crafting is the shaping of matter by hand and patience.  
    It binds the two survivors to the valley through work and endurance.  

FORM
    All forms arise from visible matter.  Each cut, knot, and join must be seen.  
    Nothing is conjured, nothing is hidden.  Every tool, weapon, and armor piece  
    belongs to this record when its making can be traced from what lies in reach.

CATEGORIES
    tools      implements that serve the body in labour and repair  
    weapons    instruments that carry force for hunting or defense  
    armor      coverings that turn tooth, claw, wind, or cold  

USE
    The pages that follow describe each class of making in their lawful order.  
    They hold no secret instruction, only the witness of matter shaped to purpose.

NOTES
    Crafting is labour, not progress.  A form once lost must be relearned by sight.  
    The valley permits no art beyond what its soil and ruin provide.  
    Every object that endures does so because the hands remember.

%%% crafting/armor/00_armor_index.txt %%%

NAME
    armor index

DESCRIPTION
    Armor is the second skin of survival.  
    It guards flesh against tooth, edge, and cold.  
    Every piece is woven from fear, necessity, and the patience of hands.

FORM
    Hide shaped and stitched.  Bone pierced and strung.  
    Reed padded into layers.  Bark pressed and smoked until pliant.  
    From these beginnings come the coverings that keep life where it belongs.

CATEGORIES
    hidework       the soft barrier between skin and storm  
    bonework       the hard shell against claw and stone  
    reedpadding    the quiet armor of cold and silence  
    shields        the held wall between self and harm  
    trophies       the marks of victory worn as proof or prayer

USE
    Armor slows the world’s intention.  
    It absorbs what would otherwise end the motion of the living.

NOTES
    Protection is weight.  Warmth is burden.  
    The wise know when to wear defense and when to shed it.

%%% crafting/armor/01_hidework.txt %%%

NAME
    hidework

DESCRIPTION
    Hidework is the oldest form of shelter carried on the body.  
    It turns the death of beast into the warmth of survival.  
    Each layer bears the scent of smoke, fat, and rain.

FORM
    Fresh hide scraped clean, stretched across wood, dried in shade.  
    When pliant, rubbed with ash and grease until soft to touch.  
    Cut to shape and stitched with sinew or grass cord.  
    Smoke darkens the surface and drives out the last of blood.

USE
    For covering the body, for binding the hands in frost, for wrapping the feet.  
    Thick hides guard the chest from thorn and blow; thin ones bend with movement.  
    Worn close, they breathe with the wearer’s heat.

LIMITS
    Hide stiffens when soaked, rots when sealed too long from air.  
    Fire will cure it or consume it-no middle path endures.

NOTES
    The first garment was an answer to the wind.  
    Every piece of hidework repeats that conversation.

%%% crafting/armor/02_bonework.txt %%%

NAME
    bonework

DESCRIPTION
    Bonework is armor made from the valley’s remains.  
    It takes the strength of what has fallen and gives it new purpose.  
    Every plate remembers a creature’s motion even in stillness.

FORM
    Ribs split lengthwise and drilled for cord.  
    Shoulder blades ground flat and fitted in rows along hide backing.  
    Long bones carved into narrow slats, bound together with sinew and wax.  
    Smoke and ash seal the surface against damp.

USE
    Worn over chest and arm to turn claw, tooth, and falling stone.  
    Heavy, loud, but steadfast.  In winter it holds heat as well as defense.  
    The weight settles upon the body until strength and burden are one.

LIMITS
    Bone cracks in deep cold and softens when left in rain.  
    Each piece must be dried by firelight and restrung before use.

NOTES
    To wear bonework is to walk with the memory of other lives.  
    Every plate sings faintly when struck, a hollow echo of what it once was.

%%% crafting/armor/03_reedpadding.txt %%%

NAME
    reedpadding

DESCRIPTION
    Reedpadding is the armor of quiet places.  
    It is woven from the hollow stems that grow where water lingers and wind is soft.  
    Its purpose is warmth first, protection second, silence always.

FORM
    Reeds gathered at dusk, split and dried by the fire’s edge.  
    Bundled and stitched into mats with cord of bark or grass.  
    The mats layered over hide or cloth, sewn into vests and sleeves.  
    Moss or lichen pressed between layers for softness and insulation.

USE
    For keeping the cold from bone and dulling the blow of branch or fall.  
    Favored by those who hunt with bow, for it makes no sound in motion.  
    When damp, it smells of earth and smoke but keeps its shape.

LIMITS
    Reeds grow brittle in frost and must be replaced with the season.  
    If soaked too long, the stitching loosens and decay begins from within.

NOTES
    Reedpadding does not fight; it endures.  
    It teaches that defense can be found in gentleness.

%%% crafting/armor/04_shields.txt %%%

NAME
    shields

DESCRIPTION
    The shield is the held wall between the body and the world.  
    It is armor that moves with the will, turning danger aside through balance and timing.  
    In the valley it is built from what stands firm and bends without breaking.

FORM
    A circle of wood or woven branch, its rim bound with hide.  
    The face stretched tight with raw skin, smoked until it hardens.  
    A handgrip carved from bone or antler fixed at the heart.  
    Some bear plates of slate or fragments of ruin metal pressed into their surface.  
    Smoke and resin darken them against the glare of snow.

USE
    To catch the force of strike, to hide movement, to push through thorn and crowd.  
    When raised, it is a door that opens only one way.  
    In rest it serves as seat, table, or shelter from rain.

LIMITS
    Wood swells and twists in wet.  Hide shrinks and splits in heat.  
    A broken rim must be unbound and remade; a cracked face cannot be mended.

NOTES
    The shield belongs to the moment before impact.  
    Its worth is measured in what it prevents, not what it endures.

%%% crafting/armor/05_trophies.txt %%%

NAME
    trophies

DESCRIPTION
    Trophies are not armor of need but of remembrance.  
    They are worn when survival has been proven, not when it is in doubt.  
    Each piece tells of a meeting between the living and the greater powers of the valley.

FORM
    Teeth and claws drilled and strung upon cord.  
    Horn plates polished and set into hide bands.  
    A strip of fur wrapped at wrist or throat, still carrying its scent.  
    Feathers bound to cord, shifting with the motion of breath.  
    Bone carved into charm or edge to mark endurance.

USE
    For ceremony of silence and for courage before hunt.  
    To remind the wearer of what was taken and what was spared.  
    Some believe the spirit of the fallen walks beside its keeper until forgotten.

LIMITS
    Ornament invites memory but not protection.  
    Weight without purpose wearies the body.  
    The valley cares little for pride worn on the skin.

NOTES
    A trophy kept too long becomes burden.  
    The wise return them to earth before envy grows.

%%% crafting/tools/00_tools_index.txt %%%

NAME
    tools index

DESCRIPTION
    Tools are the extensions of hand and thought.  
    Each one exists to shape, divide, bind, carry, or mend the matter of the valley.  
    Their making follows the same law as their use: nothing hidden, nothing wasted.

FORM
    The simplest tool is born from contact between hard and soft.  
    Stone strikes wood, bone scrapes hide, cord draws tight around haft.  
    Fire seals what fingers cannot hold.

CATEGORIES
    firemaking     the work of heat and ember  
    cutting        the making of edges and their upkeep  
    binding        the joining of parts by cord, sinew, or glue  
    gathering      the carrying and keeping of food or fiber  
    repair         the restoration of what is frayed or broken  
    waterwork      the holding and warming of water without vessel

USE
    Tools allow survival to become repetition.  
    Through them, each act is remembered by the marks it leaves in wood and soil.

NOTES
    No tool stands apart from its maker.  Every handle shows the wear of its user.  
    When one breaks, the valley returns it to material and waits to be shaped again.

%%% crafting/tools/01_firemaking.txt %%%

NAME
    firemaking

DESCRIPTION
    Fire is the first companion and the final witness.  
    It answers friction, spark, and breath, and gives shape to night.  
    Its tools are few, but their absence is hunger and cold.

FORM
    A spindle of dry wood spun between palms upon a base of softer grain.  
    Dust gathers, darkens, and begins to live.  
    A spark struck from stone against iron, caught in bark or fungus.  
    Breath feeds it until flame stands.

USE
    Fire cleans, hardens, softens, preserves.  
    It drives the wet from hide and seals the bond of glue.  
    It marks the boundary between the living and the frozen earth.

LIMITS
    Flame cannot be stored.  Each ember must be carried or reborn.  
    When the air is heavy with rain, the valley holds its breath and waits.

NOTES
    Ash is memory of heat.  Smoke is its voice.  
    Those who keep the ember keep the law of warmth.

%%% crafting/tools/02_cutting.txt %%%

NAME
    cutting

DESCRIPTION
    Edges divide what the hand cannot.  
    They give order to hide and bone, to stalk and branch.  
    Every blade in the valley is born of fracture and pressure.

FORM
    A shard of glassy stone struck from a larger mass.  
    A rib ground thin against slate until it draws light along its edge.  
    A flake of bone or iron bound with wet sinew to a wooden grasp.  
    Heat and resin fix what time would loosen.

USE
    Skinning and carving.  Shaping shafts and clearing root.  
    Preparing food and mending camp.  
    A knife or scraper, each named only by its work.

LIMITS
    No edge endures without care.  Each dulls and must be renewed by hand.  
    A careless strike will break both stone and wrist.

NOTES
    The valley teaches patience through its edges.  
    A single flake, turned right, can feed a life.

%%% crafting/tools/03_binding.txt %%%

NAME
    binding

DESCRIPTION
    Binding is the art of joining what would fall apart.  
    It turns fiber and tendon into memory of shape.  
    Through it, the tools of the valley hold together against strain and time.

FORM
    Strips of bark peeled thin and twisted while green.  
    Sinew drawn from fresh kill, washed, stretched, and dried in shadow.  
    Cord woven from grass or reed, sealed with tallow to resist the wet.  
    Resin warmed by ember and pressed between joined parts.

USE
    For hafting heads to shafts, for stitching hide, for setting traps,  
    for weaving nets, and for building walls of reed or branch.  
    Where the hand cannot hold, binding remains.

LIMITS
    Fibers weaken in water and rot if left unkept.  
    Sinew stiffens in frost.  Resin cracks when overfired.

NOTES
    Every bond is temporary.  The law of binding is vigilance.  
    What endures does so because it is remade.

%%% crafting/tools/04_gathering.txt %%%

NAME
    gathering

DESCRIPTION
    Gathering is the quiet labour between hunger and plenty.  
    It brings the valley’s small offerings into reach-seed, root, fiber, shell.  
    Its tools are baskets, wraps, and hooks shaped from what they seek to hold.

FORM
    A net of cord woven between pliant branches.  
    A basket frame bent from willow and lined with moss.  
    A hooked twig cut to pull fruit from high stems.  
    A reed mat folded and tied for drying herbs and grain.

USE
    For carrying food and fuel, for sorting stone and chaff,  
    for keeping harvest from damp soil and wind.  
    Every gatherer leaves a trace of order in the wild.

LIMITS
    Fiber loosens when soaked, bark splits under frost.  
    Each vessel must be emptied, dried, and shaped anew with the season.

NOTES
    The valley gives in fragments.  Gathering teaches how to piece them whole.  
    What is carried home becomes part of the hands that bore it.

%%% crafting/tools/05_repair.txt %%%

NAME
    repair

DESCRIPTION
    Repair is the act of refusal against loss.  
    It holds the line between usefulness and ruin.  
    Every mended thing carries the story of its breaking.

FORM
    Hide patch pressed warm and stitched across a tear.  
    Sinew thread drawn through old holes to tighten a loosened seam.  
    A split shaft joined by binding and sealed with resin.  
    A frayed cord twisted together until it hums with tension once more.

USE
    To extend the life of what labour made.  
    To keep edge, rope, and garment whole for another season.  
    Each repair is a conversation between wear and will.

LIMITS
    Nothing endures forever.  Every fix thins the material it saves.  
    Too much patchwork turns strength to weakness.

NOTES
    The wise repair early and often.  
    In the sealed valley, survival is measured in what is kept from falling apart.

%%% crafting/tools/06_waterwork.txt %%%

NAME
    waterwork

DESCRIPTION
    Water moves through every task of the valley.  
    To drink, to cleanse, to soften, to shape-it must be guided, held, and heated.  
    These are the means by which water becomes servant instead of master.

FORM
    A hollow pressed in clay and lined with ash, filled with stone and fire to boil.  
    A skin pouch greased with tallow, slung from cord to carry melt or rain.  
    Reeds bound tight to form a pipe, guiding stream into hand.  
    Clay crusts spread thin upon rock to gather dew at dawn.

USE
    For cooking and washing, for cooling meat, for sealing glue.  
    For every moment when warmth and cleanliness mean life.

LIMITS
    Clay splits if the flame climbs too fast.  Hide leaks when left in sun.  
    All vessels must be emptied and dried before night frost.

NOTES
    Water remembers its path.  It wears the maker’s mark even as it fades away.  
    The patient learn from its silence how to endure.

%%% crafting/weapons/00_weapons_index.txt %%%

NAME
    weapons index

DESCRIPTION
    Weapons are tools that carry intent beyond the reach of the hand.  
    They divide hunger from prey, threat from the living.  
    Each is made from the same earth and bone as its maker, and ends in the same dust.

FORM
    The shaping of weight, edge, and balance into a purpose.  
    Wood bent, stone set, cord drawn tight, bone sharpened.  
    No weapon in the valley is more than the meeting of these motions.

CATEGORIES
    bows       the curved wood that throws the arrow’s flight  
    arrows     the small and silent messengers of distance  
    axes       the weight of hand given edge and swing  
    spears     the extension of arm and caution  
    clubs      the simplest balance of blow and grip  
    thrown     the brief flight of strength through air

USE
    For hunting, for defense, for the proof of survival.  
    Each strike feeds, protects, or ends; all obey the same law of return.

NOTES
    A weapon does not belong to the one who holds it.  
    It belongs to the moment when it is used.

%%% crafting/weapons/01_bows.txt %%%

NAME
    bows

DESCRIPTION
    The bow stores the will of the hand and releases it as flight.  
    It joins wood, cord, and patience into a single motion of silence.  
    In the valley its sound is rare, a dry whisper across still air.

FORM
    A stave cut from yew or spruce, shaped by heat and scraped to balance.  
    The string twisted from sinew or grass and sealed with fat.  
    The grip wrapped in bark to keep the pulse from slipping.  
    When drawn, the arc holds breath and tension; when loosed, both are freed.

USE
    For hunting swift game across meadow or ridge.  
    For driving the arrow’s point where foot cannot follow.  
    The bow teaches stillness before strength.

LIMITS
    Wood warps in rain and slackens in thaw.  
    Each cord frays and must be replaced by hand.  
    No bow endures neglect; it is a living limb bound to weather and care.

NOTES
    The sound of release is memory made air.  
    To string a bow is to borrow power and promise to return it.


%%% crafting/weapons/02_arrows.txt %%%

NAME
    arrows

DESCRIPTION
    Arrows are the valley’s quietest voice.  
    They travel where the body cannot, carrying hunger, warning, and resolve.  
    Each one is a brief alignment of feather, shaft, and edge.

FORM
    A straight reed or wand, dried and scraped smooth.  
    Its head chipped from stone or shaped from bone and bound with sinew.  
    Feathers fixed at the tail, turned by smoke to harden against damp.  
    Resin seals each joint, scent faint of pine and ash.

USE
    For taking bird and beast, for signaling across distance.  
    For moments when the bow’s memory must be carried farther.  
    The spent arrow is gathered if found, its flight remembered in silence.

LIMITS
    Shafts warp in frost, feathers loosen in rain.  
    Obsidian shatters on stone, bone dulls on hide.  
    Every arrow dies in service and is remade from what remains.

NOTES
    The path of an arrow is the shortest prayer.  
    It begins in breath and ends in stillness.

%%% crafting/weapons/03_axes.txt %%%

NAME
    axes

DESCRIPTION
    The axe is the oldest argument between wood and stone.  
    It serves the hand that fells, shapes, and defends.  
    Its edge is both maker and destroyer within the valley.

FORM
    A wedge of slate or obsidian bound to a straight haft with sinew and resin.  
    Some heads are carved from bone or rare metal fallen from the sky.  
    The grip is wrapped in hide for steadiness and to drink the shock of impact.  
    Smoke from the first swing marks the tool as its own.

USE
    For cutting timber, breaking bone, and turning back the living when threatened.  
    For building, for clearing, for claiming warmth from tree and beast alike.  
    Each swing writes a measure of strength upon the air.

LIMITS
    Stone blunts quickly, resin loosens in heat, hafts crack when struck askew.  
    The axe demands attention after every task; neglect dulls more than use.

NOTES
    When sharpened at dawn, the axe speaks of intention.  
    Its dullness at dusk speaks of work completed.

%%% crafting/weapons/04_spears.txt %%%

NAME
    spears

DESCRIPTION
    The spear is distance made solid.  
    It reaches where the hand dares not go and keeps what is near at bay.  
    Its point is the memory of the first hunt and the promise of the next.

FORM
    A long shaft carved from straight wood, smoothed by sand and fire.  
    Its tip shaped from stone, bone, or sharpened metal, fixed with sinew and resin.  
    Some bear crosspieces of horn to stop the thrust and save the wielder’s life.  
    Balance lies where grip and weight meet in calm accord.

USE
    For driving deep into flesh or soil, for walking the uneven ground.  
    In water it becomes a fisher’s fork; in forest, a silent companion.  
    The spear is patient, waiting for approach.

LIMITS
    Shafts warp when left against heat, heads loosen with rain.  
    Each must be checked by light and sound before use; the careless die by splinter.

NOTES
    The spear teaches reach and restraint.  
    Its virtue is not in the wound, but in the distance kept.

%%% crafting/weapons/05_clubs.txt %%%

NAME
    clubs

DESCRIPTION
    The club is the valley’s simplest weapon.  
    A length of wood held until it learns the path of the arm.  
    It speaks in impact, not in edge.

FORM
    A branch chosen for weight and grain, bark left for grip.  
    Some are shaped by fire, ends blackened and hardened.  
    Others are bound with stone or bone to carry more force.  
    No two are alike, yet all remember the hand that swings them.

USE
    For striking, for breaking, for warning.  
    A tool of defense when edge is gone, a hammer when camp is built.  
    It ends quarrels with the honesty of weight.

LIMITS
    Wood splits after long service, fibers crush under cold.  
    When cracked, the club must burn or be reborn from new branch.

NOTES
    The club knows nothing of distance or aim.  
    It trusts only in closeness and resolve.

%%% crafting/weapons/06_thrown.txt %%%

NAME
    thrown weapons

DESCRIPTION
    Thrown weapons carry the strength of the body into air.  
    They bridge the space between hunter and hunted.  
    Each is a single motion cast outward, seeking rest in target or earth.

FORM
    A balanced stick curved or straight, hardened by flame.  
    Small stones shaped smooth by river and carried in hand.  
    Short spears with fire-blackened points, fitted for flight rather than thrust.  
    The art lies in release, not in ornament.

USE
    For hunting birds and hares, for driving beasts from thicket,  
    for signaling across distance when voice would betray.  
    The thrower learns the wind as kin, the arc as language.

LIMITS
    Wood swells in rain, shafts warp with time.  
    Stone strikes only once with purpose; after that it belongs to the ground.  
    No throw may be recalled once loosed.

NOTES
    The air remembers every cast.  
    Each throw is a brief surrender to gravity and chance.

%%% fauna/aquatic/00_aquatic_index.txt %%%

NAME  
    aquatic_index - water-bound and semi-aquatic fauna inhabiting lakes, swamps, and runoff zones

DESCRIPTION  
    Aquatic fauna include fish, amphibians, reptiles, and semi-submerged mammals.  
    These species reside in or near water bodies and are encountered along shorelines,  
    flood zones, or submerged terrain. Most are forageable using traps, spears, or direct hand retrieval.

    Movement and yield vary with water temperature, flow, and clarity.  
    Some species are nocturnal or responsive to geothermal cycles.  
    Presence may indicate water stability, forage density, or surface disruption.

    Entry files document harvest method, biome constraints, and behavioral rhythm.  
    All organisms are grounded in real-world analogs. No symbolic or hybrid species are used.

%%% fauna/aquatic/01_northern_pike.txt %%%

NAME  
    northern_pike - ambush freshwater predator known for sharp teeth and rapid strikes

DESCRIPTION  
    The northern pike is a large, torpedo-shaped fish found in lakes and slow-moving waters.  
    It prefers heavily vegetated zones where it hides motionless, waiting to ambush prey.  
    Its sharp, backward-facing teeth secure slippery fish and amphibians.  
    The species is solitary and highly territorial, with a strong seasonal feeding pattern.

    Pike require clear, oxygen-rich water and are sensitive to pollution or temperature extremes.  
    Spawning occurs in shallow flooded vegetation during spring thaw.  
    Northern pike are prized for meat but require careful cleaning due to numerous small bones.

USAGE  
    Used as: fresh meat source, high-protein catch for survival diet  
    Limitations: flesh contains many fine bones; not suitable for immediate consumption without preparation  
    Preparation: catch by spear or trap; gut and clean promptly; fillet carefully to avoid bones; cook thoroughly

%%% fauna/aquatic/02_brown_trout.txt %%%

NAME  
    brown_trout - adaptable freshwater fish prized for firm flesh and active behavior

DESCRIPTION  
    Brown trout inhabit cool lakes and streams, favoring areas with moderate current  
    and ample cover such as submerged logs or rocky ledges. They feed opportunistically  
    on insects, smaller fish, and crustaceans. The species tolerates a range of water qualities  
    but requires oxygen-rich environments for spawning and juvenile survival.

    Brown trout spawn in gravel beds during late autumn. Their flesh is firm and richly flavored,  
    making them a valued food source in survival contexts. Careful cleaning is necessary to remove bones.

USAGE  
    Used as: nutritious meat source, dietary staple for survival  
    Limitations: contains pin bones; requires preparation to avoid choking hazards  
    Preparation: capture with spear or trap; gut and clean immediately; fillet carefully; cook thoroughly

%%% fauna/aquatic/03_freshwater_eel.txt %%%

NAME  
    freshwater_eel - elongated nocturnal predator inhabiting swampy and slow-moving waters

DESCRIPTION  
    The freshwater eel is a slender, snake-like fish that favors swamp and lake margins with dense cover.  
    Primarily active at night, it preys on small fish, amphibians, and invertebrates.  
    Eels migrate seasonally to spawning grounds, often requiring unobstructed waterways.  
    Their skin is slimy and tough, requiring thorough cleaning before consumption.

    Eels provide a rich, fatty meat valuable for survival nutrition. Their slippery bodies  
    make capture challenging, commonly requiring specialized traps or hand retrieval.

USAGE  
    Used as: fatty protein source, high-calorie catch for extended energy needs  
    Limitations: requires careful handling to remove slime; capture methods are specialized  
    Preparation: trap or snare in cover zones; skin thoroughly; gut and clean before cooking

ZONE PRESENCE  
    Biomes: swamp, lake

SCIENTIFIC NAME

%%% fauna/aquatic/04_muskrat.txt %%%

NAME  
    muskrat - small semi-aquatic rodent valued for fur and meat in wetland zones

DESCRIPTION  
    Muskrats inhabit marshes, lakes, and slow streams where they build burrows or lodges.  
    They feed on aquatic plants, roots, and occasionally small animals.  
    Muskrats are primarily nocturnal and are active year-round, using thick fur for insulation.

    Their pelts provide essential warmth in cold environments, while their meat is a moderate protein source.  
    Trapping muskrats is common, using baited snares or cage traps near feeding areas.

USAGE  
    Used as: fur source for insulation, meat for survival protein  
    Limitations: small size yields limited meat; trapping requires knowledge of habitat  
    Preparation: trap near vegetation zones; skin carefully to preserve fur; cook meat thoroughly

ZONE PRESENCE

%%% fauna/aquatic/05_bullfrog.txt %%%

NAME  
    bullfrog - large amphibian common in wetlands, valued for meat and signaling

DESCRIPTION  
    The bullfrog is a robust amphibian found in swamp, flood hollow, and lake environments.  
    It feeds on insects, small fish, and occasionally other amphibians. Its loud call is a common  
    nighttime signal in wetland zones. Bullfrogs have thick skin and strong legs adapted for jumping  
    and swimming.

    Bullfrog meat is edible and can supplement protein intake. They are often caught by hand or with traps.  
    Their presence indicates healthy aquatic ecosystems.

USAGE  
    Used as: supplementary meat source, environmental indicator species  
    Limitations: limited meat yield per individual; capture requires active pursuit  
    Preparation: catch by hand or trap; remove skin and legs; cook thoroughly before consumption

DESCRIPTION  
    The common toad is a terrestrial amphibian found near water bodies such as wetlands and moist slopes.  
    It feeds primarily on invertebrates and small insects. Toads secrete mild toxins through their skin,  
    which deters many predators. Their thick, warty skin provides protection and moisture retention.

    Toad meat can be consumed cautiously, typically after thorough cooking to avoid toxin effects.  
    They are captured using traps or by hand during nocturnal activity periods.

USAGE  
    Used as: supplemental meat source, small-game catch in wet habitats  
    Limitations: skin secretions require removal or thorough cooking; small size limits yield  
    Preparation: trap or hand-capture at night; skin carefully; cook thoroughly to neutralize toxins

NAME  
    coyote - opportunistic predator and scavenger active across open and forested zones

DESCRIPTION  
    The coyote is a medium-sized carnivore known for its adaptability and varied diet.  
    It hunts rodents, birds, and small ungulates, and scavenges readily from kills or camps.  
    Coyotes often operate alone or in loose pairs, howling to signal territory or coordinate.

    Tracks are narrow and straight. Active during twilight and night hours.  
    Their alertness and erratic behavior make trapping unreliable without bait or distraction.

USAGE  
    Used as: light pelt for inner linings, bone for small implements, sinew for cordage  
    Limitations: wary and evasive; best taken at bait points or from elevated blind  
    Preparation: skin carefully to retain tail and flank; dry quickly in shaded airflow

NAME  
    stoat - agile cold-adapted hunter of rodents and small birds

DESCRIPTION  
    The stoat is a tiny, fast-moving mustelid active across tundra and meadow terrain.  
    It preys on voles, eggs, and nesting birds, using burrows, snow tunnels, and rock gaps for cover.  
    In cold seasons, its fur shifts to pure white, making it difficult to detect in snow-covered ground.

    Stoats are solitary and highly territorial.  
    Their pelts are prized for trim and fine insulation, especially during winter molt.  
    Tracks are small and bounding, often found near field edge or stream burrows.

USAGE  
    Used as: fine pelt for glove or hood lining, light bone tools, and charm materials  
    Limitations: small yield; requires specific traps or winter tracking skill

NAME  
    scavengers_index - opportunistic fauna that feed on carrion, waste, or field residue

DESCRIPTION  
    Scavengers are non-predatory organisms that consume decaying material, discarded remains,  
    or abandoned field kill. Most avoid conflict and operate on the margins of active zones.  
    Their presence often signals recent death, biome stress, or predatory activity.

    Scavengers are typically nocturnal or crepuscular. Tracks may be shallow, inconsistent,  
    or overlaid with prey prints. Behavioral patterns include delayed approach,  
    object interference, or trap theft. Visibility is low; audio signals may be masked.

    These species are rarely hunted. Value lies in observation, bait control, and environmental read.  
    Entry files document interaction logic, yield (if applicable), and terrain disruption risk.

DESCRIPTION  
    Signal species are not hunted. They serve as indirect indicators of threat proximity,  
    weather shift, territorial disruption, or biome transition. These fauna are passive,  
    small, and often vocal. Silence, altered movement, or absence may carry greater  
    weight than direct observation.

    Signal behavior is used to plan shelter, assess danger, or confirm movement corridors.  
    Entries are selected for ecological reliability, biome specificity, and pattern clarity.  
    Each species is native to the sealed valley and does not serve as direct resource yield.

    Entry files document sound profile, disturbance response, and observational thresholds.

NAME  
    dragonfly - aerial hover insect used to mark water purity and air stratification

DESCRIPTION  
    The dragonfly glides and hovers in still air over clean water margins.  
    It appears only when aquatic microclimate, sunlight, and wind calm intersect.  
    Disappearance signals turbidity, pollutant bloom, or thermal disturbance.

    Most active in daylight with high visibility.  
    Resting occurs on reeds or stones between bursts of linear flight.

USAGE  
    Used as: water-edge indicator of purity and air balance; loss implies weather, flow, or chemical shift  
    Limitations: seasonal; absent in high wind or over darkened pools  
    Observation: track flight height, orbit pattern, and abrupt dispersal across clustered surface zones

NAME  
    yew_stavewood - dense, flexible wood used for shaping bows and tool cores

DESCRIPTION  
    Yew is a slow-growing conifer with reddish heartwood valued for its strength and  
    elasticity. Its wood carves cleanly and resists cracking under tension, making it  
    ideal for bow construction, hafts, or reinforced bindings. Best harvested in dry,  
    cold conditions when sap content is low. Outer layers are brittle and should be  
    removed to expose the workable inner stave.

    The tree grows in scattered highland margins and forest transition zones.  
    Bark is thin and scaly. Needles are dark and flattened. Mature specimens may  
    yield one or two usable branches per season. Not suited for firewood or fiber.

USAGE  
    Used as: bow limbs, weapon hafts, structural inserts requiring elastic strength  
    Limitations: sapwood must be removed; wood must be seasoned or it will split  
    Preparation: cut from main branch, split longitudinally, and dry through one full freeze-thaw cycle

NAME  
    spruce_heartwood - straight-grained conifer core used for shafts, frames, and planking

DESCRIPTION  
    Spruce produces a pale, lightweight heartwood with excellent directional strength.  
    It splits cleanly and holds shape under moderate load, making it suitable for arrow shafts,  
    struts, sled runners, and framed structures. It is not as dense as yew, but easier to  
    gather, season, and shape. Should be used dry; fresh-cut spruce may warp or split unevenly.

    Grows in dense, cold-tolerant stands at elevation or northern slope.  
    Bark is scaly and flaking; needles are four-sided and clustered around the branch.  
    Heartwood lies beneath the pale sap layer and should be taken from trunks or large limbs  
    above root flare. Burns poorly and is not suitable as kindling.

USAGE  
    Used as: arrow shafts, sled runners, structural framing under moderate load  
    Limitations: prone to warping if shaped wet; softens near heat or flame  
    Preparation: split from trunk core, debarked, and dried flat or bundled with airflow

%%% flora/crafting/07_sagebrush_stalk.txt %%%

NAME  
    sagebrush_stalk - brittle shrub stem used for fast ignition and loose tinder

DESCRIPTION  
    Sagebrush is a woody, drought-adapted shrub found across arid and wind-stripped terrain.  
    Its stems dry into hollow, brittle stalks that snap cleanly and ignite rapidly, making  
    them ideal for firestarting or padding tinder bundles. It is not suitable for structure  
    or load-bearing use. Growth is low and branching, with narrow leaves and a pungent scent  
    when disturbed. Found scattered along open slopes or exposed basins.

    Harvested stems burn hot and fast with minimal smoke.  
    Ineffective when damp and should be stored in dry wrap.  
    Adds volume to tinder but offers no sustained heat.  
    Collection is easiest by hand during dry season. 

USAGE  
    Used as: ignition material, dry tinder volume, short-burn fuel supplement  
    Limitations: ineffective when wet; not suitable for prolonged combustion

%%% flora/crafting/08_mullein_leaf.txt %%%

NAME  
    mullein_leaf - broad, woolly leaf used for wrap insulation and fire-start padding

DESCRIPTION  
    Mullein is a tall, flowering herb with large fuzzy leaves that grow in a basal rosette.  
    The leaf surface is covered in dense trichomes, making it highly absorbent and soft to the touch.  
    When dried, mullein leaves provide lightweight insulation and are useful for wrapping, lining,  
    or as padding in packs and containers. Though flammable, they are more valuable as material  
    than direct fuel. Not edible. Inhalation of smoke is discouraged.

    Found in disturbed soil, exposed slopes, or meadow edge zones.  
    Leaves grow low to the ground in early stages, followed by a tall central flowering spike.  
    Harvest before flowering for best texture. Dry flat to preserve leaf shape and flexibility.

USAGE  
    Used as: insulation wrap, gear lining, quiver padding, fire-start backing  
    Limitations: loses structure if sun-dried; smoke is irritating if burned  
    Preparation: gather outer leaves before flowering, press and dry in shade, fold gently if stored

%%% flora/crafting/09_pine_tree.txt %%%

NAME  
    pine_tree - resinous highland conifer used for pitch and fire support

DESCRIPTION  
    Pine is a tall, cold-adapted conifer found in evergreen forests and upper slopes.  
    It produces thick, scaly bark and exudes amber resin at damaged sites. Resin is soft  
    when warm and brittle when cold. Bark can be rendered to extract dense, tar-like pitch  
    suitable for sealing and ignition. Both materials are valuable in survival tasks  
    requiring adhesion, waterproofing, or fire acceleration.

    Resin is scraped from natural seep or shallow cuts and stored cool. Pitch is produced  
    by boiling bark flakes or scorching over fire, then cooled and packed in bark wrap.  
    Collection is safest in dry weather from downed trees or mature specimens.  
    Pine wood is unsuitable for load-bearing use due to warping and splinter risk.  
    Resin and pitch are not interchangeable but derived from the same source.

USAGE  
    Used as: resin sealant, spark paste base, fire bundle coating, ignition delay layer  
    Limitations: pitch is brittle when cold; resin flow is seasonal and localized  
    Preparation: scrape resin with bone or bark edge, warm to soften; render pitch from bark flakes over flame and store cool in wrap

%%% flora/crafting/10_tamarisk_wand.txt %%%

NAME  
    tamarisk_wand - flexible woody stem used for trap arms and lightweight framing

DESCRIPTION  
    Tamarisk is a shrubby plant found in saline flats and drainage-prone lowlands.  
    It produces long, slender stems that remain springy even when dried, making them  
    ideal for tension arms, light trap triggers, or temporary frame extensions.  
    Bark is thin and peels easily. Wood is not strong but holds shape under light  
    force and rebounds cleanly when bent. Growth is dense and often forms thickets  
    near flood retreats or exposed sediment layers.

    Harvested stems are best taken before full lignification sets in.  
    Older stalks become brittle and prone to snapping.  
    The wood burns poorly and is not used for fuel.  
    Surface grain is smooth; can be shaved or notched without splitting.

USAGE  
    Used as: trap arms, flexible framing, shaft core material, tension lash insert  
    Limitations: brittle if harvested too late; not suitable for weight-bearing load  
    Preparation: cut near base, strip bark, dry straight or bind into curve under tension

DESCRIPTION  
    Cattail rhizomes grow horizontally beneath shallow water in marshes and lake margins.  
    They are thick, fibrous roots rich in starch and edible tissue. When harvested, the  
    rhizomes can be peeled and boiled to produce a dense, nutritious pulp. Drying and  
    grinding yield a coarse meal useful in survival rations. Spoilage is rapid if left  
    wet after harvesting. Best gathered in cool, low-flow water.

    The plant’s above-ground features include tall, spear-like leaves and a dark brown  
    cylindrical flower spike. Rhizomes grow from the base of mature stalks and often  
    run in networks along the mud layer.

USAGE

DESCRIPTION  
    Nettles are fast-growing herbaceous plants found along semi-shaded forest margins  
    and moist slopes. They are identified by their serrated leaves and fine stinging  
    hairs which deliver a mild irritant on contact. Once boiled or dried, the stingers  
    are neutralized and the leaves become a nutrient-rich food source high in iron,  
    vitamins, and protein.

    Nettles grow in clusters, often near disturbed soil or water runoff paths.  
    Harvesting is safest with gloves or cloth. Leaves are best taken young and tender.  
    Also usable for tea or dried additive in ration mixes.

USAGE  
    Used as: boiled greens, tea infusion, dried additive in ration mixes

    bluegrass_seeds - clustered grass seed used for coarse meal and ration filler

DESCRIPTION  
    Bluegrass is a common wild grass forming dense mats in open terrain.  
    During late-season dry periods, its upper stalks develop compact seed heads  
    that can be stripped and processed into a coarse, low-oil meal. Though not  
    calorie-rich, the seeds offer bulk and can extend limited rations.  
    Most effective when ground and cooked into paste or dry cakes.

    Growth occurs in patches across open meadows and light wood margins.  
    Blades are narrow and deep green. Seed heads emerge upright, branching  
    in narrow fans. Harvesting is done by stripping the upper stalk by hand  
    or blade and separating chaff.

USAGE  
    Used as: coarse meal for flatbread, ration filler, or travel paste base  
    Limitations: low in fat and protein; must be ground or cooked before digestion

    bog_cranberries - tart red fruit growing on creeping wetland vine

DESCRIPTION  
    Bog cranberries are low-growing vines found in cold, acidic wetlands.  
    The plants produce small red berries that ripen late in the season.  
    Fruits are high in moisture, mildly astringent, and provide essential  
    vitamins in foraging scenarios. While sharp in taste, they are safe  
    to eat raw and can be mashed, dried, or preserved. The vines often form  
    mats across peat beds or shallow lake margins.

    Leaves are small and evergreen. Flowers appear pink in spring.  
    Berries grow close to the ground and are best harvested before snowfall.  
    The fruit’s acidic nature makes it resistant to quick spoilage.

USAGE  
    Used as: raw forage fruit, vitamin supplement, mashable ration additive  
    Limitations: low caloric value; limited yield per area

DESCRIPTION  
    Wild sorrel is a low-growing herbaceous plant with soft, arrow-shaped leaves.  
    It thrives in disturbed soil, meadows, and light-exposed clearings.  
    The leaves have a sharp, lemon-like flavor due to oxalic acid, making them  
    useful in small quantities for appetite stimulation and hydration.  
    Though nutritious, sorrel should not be consumed in large amounts over time  
    due to its mild anti-nutritional effects.

    Grows in clustered rosettes with smooth, bright green leaves and thin stems.  
    Most tender when harvested early in the season. Often found near stones or  
    along the edge of grass zones where tree cover breaks.

USAGE  
    Used as: chewable moisture source, stimulant forage, tea base for fatigue

%%% flora/edibles/07_hazelnuts.txt %%%

NAME  
    hazelnuts - high-fat seasonal nut from deciduous shrub

DESCRIPTION  
    Hazelnuts grow on compact, multi-stemmed shrubs found in forest margins and  
    temperate woodlands. The nuts form inside fibrous outer husks and hard inner shells.  
    When fully ripe, they fall to the ground and can be collected for their high  
    fat and caloric content. Hazelnuts can be eaten raw, roasted, or ground into  
    paste or flour. Their oil content makes them valuable for survival scenarios  
    requiring dense energy with minimal volume.

    The plant has rounded, serrated leaves and produces catkins in early spring.  
    Nuts ripen in late season. Squirrels and foragers often compete for fallen yield.  
    Best collected after husks begin to dry but before shell rot sets in.

USAGE  
    Used as: high-energy forage, roasted kernel, paste or flour base for compact rations  
    Limitations: shell rot after ripening if left exposed; vulnerable to animal competition

NAME  
    firethorn_berry - clustered red fruit from thorn-bearing scrub

DESCRIPTION  
    Firethorn is a dense, thorn-covered shrub that produces small red to orange berries  
    in tightly packed clusters. It grows along disturbed slopes, rocky margins, and  
    post-burn zones where undergrowth is sparse. The berries are high in moisture  
    and carbohydrates but mildly irritating when raw. In small quantities, they are  
    safe; larger amounts may cause stomach upset unless cooked or dried.

    Shrubs can grow over two meters in height. Thorns are sharp and rigid,  
    making harvest hazardous without gloves or a stripping cloth. The plant  
    also serves as a natural barrier, often used instinctively by animals

%%% flora/edibles/09_rose_hip.txt %%%

NAME  
    rose_hip - vitamin-rich fruit from wild rose shrubs

DESCRIPTION  
    Rose hips are the bulbous seed pods that form after the petals of wild roses fall.  
    They are rich in vitamin C and can be foraged in late season, especially after the first frost.  
    The outer skin is firm and waxy; inside is a pulp containing fine hairs and seeds.  
    Eaten raw in small amounts or boiled into syrup or tea. The hairs are irritating  
    and should be removed if possible. Rose hips are a high-value survival forage  
    where fruiting plants are otherwise scarce.

    The shrub has thorny stems, serrated leaves, and pink to pale white flowers.  
    Found along forest edges, hillsides, and stone breaks. Fruit ripens to deep orange  
    or red and remains attached into early frost periods.

USAGE  
    Used as: vitamin-rich infusion, fruit mash, survival forage during frost season  
    Limitations: inner hairs cause throat irritation; seed removal recommended  
    Preparation: slice open to remove seeds when possible; dry whole or boil into tea or paste

NAME  
    lambs_quarters - fast-growing leafy green with high mineral content

DESCRIPTION  
    Lambs quarters is a hardy annual plant found in disturbed soil, open clearings,  
    and forest margins. Its soft, pale-green leaves are coated in a fine white film  
    and are rich in calcium, iron, and vitamins A and C. The leaves and young shoots  
    are edible raw or cooked. Older leaves develop oxalates and are better boiled  
    before consumption. Highly nutritious and easily overlooked among common brush.

    The plant has a branching habit, with triangular leaves and a dusty appearance  
    near the growing tip. Seeds form in dense clusters late in the season and are  
    also edible when ground. It thrives in moist ground and grows quickly after  
    ground disturbance or flood retreat.

USAGE  
    Used as: boiled greens, raw forage, dried ration filler, or seed meal  
    Limitations: older leaves contain oxalates; cooking recommended before extended use  
    Preparation: harvest young leaves and rinse; cook lightly or consume raw; collect and grind seeds when mature

NAME  
    alpine_bistort - starchy mountain plant with edible root and shoot

DESCRIPTION  
    Alpine bistort is a short, hardy perennial found in cold alpine and tundra regions.  
    It produces a thick, knotted root rich in starch, and a small pink or white flower  
    spike on a simple upright stem. The root is the primary food source, dug and  
    boiled or dried into meal. Young leaves are edible raw but become tough with age.  
    The plant grows in clusters, often near glacial margins or exposed stone breaks.

    It tolerates frost and poor soil, relying on short growing windows and stored energy.  
    The root can be mistaken for similar plants but has a distinctive pinkish tone  
    and knotty segments. Difficult to harvest in frozen soil, but high in survival value  
    due to its carbohydrate density and cold resilience.

USAGE  
    Used as: boiled starch source, dried fallback ration, or meal additive  
    Limitations: root is difficult to extract from frozen or compacted ground  
    Preparation: dig root with blade or spike, scrub clean, boil until soft or dry and grind

%%% flora/indicator/01_reindeer_lichen.txt %%%

NAME  
    reindeer_lichen - pale ground lichen indicating persistent cold and mineral-poor substrate

DESCRIPTION  
    Reindeer lichen is a dense, bushy lichen with a pale, whitish-green color  
    and a coral-like branching structure. It grows directly on the soil or thin moss  
    crust in open tundra and frost sink zones. Its slow growth rate and sensitivity  
    to disturbance make it a reliable indicator of long-term cold exposure, dry wind,  
    and low-nutrient soil.

    The presence of reindeer lichen often marks terrain that is stable but barren,  
    with poor topsoil and minimal plant competition. Its distribution may be  
    interrupted by ice crusts, exposed rock, or repeated freeze-thaw scouring.

USAGE  
    Indicator of: prolonged permafrost exposure, low soil fertility, limited melt infiltration  
    Limitations: does not grow in compacted areas or where foot traffic is frequent  
    Observation: avoid as travel route; growth signals cold persistence and poor yield zones

%%% flora/indicator/02_sphagnum_moss.txt %%%

NAME  
    sphagnum_moss - moisture-retaining moss indicating peat formation and standing saturation

DESCRIPTION  
    Sphagnum moss forms dense, spongy mats in lowland wetlands, shallow basins,  
    and poorly drained flood zones. It has a bright green to reddish tone depending  
    on acidity and saturation level. Each plant absorbs many times its weight in  
    water, creating stable, slow-draining environments ideal for bog succession.

    Its presence signifies long-term water retention, poor drainage, and acidic soil.  
    Areas dominated by sphagnum are difficult to traverse and prone to deep-rooted  
    instability. Below the moss layer, anaerobic conditions and organic buildup  
    may produce methane or concealed pockets of unstable peat.

USAGE  
    Indicator of: persistent wetland saturation, high water table, acidic anaerobic soil  
    Limitations: surface may appear solid but often hides soft substrate  
    Observation: avoid crossing large mats; growth suggests impassable or dangerous ground

%%% flora/indicator/03_horsetail_fern.txt %%%

NAME  
    horsetail_fern - segmented wetland fern indicating silty floodplain and shallow subsurface water

DESCRIPTION  
    Horsetail is a primitive vascular plant with jointed, hollow stems  
    and radial stem whorls. It thrives in saturated soils along lake margins,  
    drainage paths, and periodically flooded hollows. Its presence indicates  
    high silt content, shallow seasonal saturation, and mineral runoff deposition.

    Horsetail colonies expand by underground rhizomes and can spread rapidly  
    after disturbance or water fluctuation. Above-ground stalks are stiff,  
    ridged, and dark green with a bristled surface texture. Growth is highly  
    sensitive to drainage and soil composition, making it useful for  
    reading terrain transitions in waterlogged zones.

USAGE  
    Indicator of: silty or mineral-rich wetland soil, high seasonal moisture, low gradient runoff  
    Limitations: presence may fade in prolonged dry cycles or near dense canopy  
    Observation: growth signals sediment-rich flood history and shallow groundwater access

NAME  
    wolf_lichen - bright green lichen indicating clean air, open exposure, and dry bark substrate

DESCRIPTION  
    Wolf lichen is a bushy, fluorescent yellow-green lichen that grows on bark,  
    deadwood, and exposed rock in well-ventilated, dry climates. Its presence reflects  
    high air quality, strong solar exposure, and unshaded conditions, typically  
    along ridgelines, sparse evergreen stands, or wind-exposed slopes.

    The lichen prefers dry, acidic substrates and does not tolerate pollution or  
    deep canopy. Its coloration makes it visible from distance, and it often appears  
    first on weathered trees in transition zones. Abundant growth may signal poor soil  
    retention and surface desiccation.

USAGE  
    Indicator of: high solar exposure, dry slope climate, and low atmospheric pollution  
    Limitations: absent under heavy canopy or in saturated zones  
    Observation: useful for tracing ridgeline dryness and open terrain stability

NAME  
    clubmoss - creeping ground cover indicating cold shade, acidic soil, and periglacial surface

DESCRIPTION  
    Clubmoss is a low-growing vascular plant resembling miniature conifers.  
    It forms dense mats across shaded forest floors and glacial fringes,  
    often where soil is thin, cold, and acidic. Growth is slow, spreading by rhizomes  
    in undisturbed environments with stable shade and low competition.

    Its presence signals poor decomposition rates, reduced sunlight, and surface  
    conditions shaped by glacial runoff or freeze-thaw erosion. Clubmoss often grows  
    alongside fungi or lichens but avoids water-saturated ground. Shoots are stiff,  
    upright, and covered in scale-like leaves that remain evergreen.

USAGE  
    Indicator of: glacially influenced soil, low nutrient turnover, long-term canopy shade  
    Limitations: disappears under canopy disturbance or thermal fluctuation  
    Observation: confirms low-yield terrain with cold buffering and limited soil formation

    polypody_fern - leathery-leaved fern indicating stable moisture and shallow mineral substrate

DESCRIPTION  
    Polypody fern grows in clumps along rock faces, fallen logs, and moist soil banks.  
    It thrives in areas with constant, non-saturated moisture and partial light.  
    Its leathery fronds are evergreen in milder cycles, curling during cold or dry periods.  
    The plant is sensitive to mechanical disturbance but resilient under stable moisture exposure.

    Its presence reflects shallow soil, high mineral content, and consistent humidity.  
    It anchors itself in mossy or organic debris over stone, preferring places  
    where runoff occurs but does not collect. Useful in identifying low-flow slope transitions.

USAGE  
    Indicator of: persistent humidity, surface mineral exposure, thin soil over rock  
    Limitations: absent from flooded, compacted, or sun-exposed terrain

DESCRIPTION  
    Haircap moss forms dense, upright colonies with stiff green stalks and  
    star-shaped tips. It prefers undisturbed soil with persistent cold moisture,  
    often appearing near melt runoffs, frost pockets, or shaded forest depressions.  
    The plant retains water effectively and remains upright even during frost exposure,  
    making it a useful marker of ground-level thermal buffering.

    Growth indicates low pH, shaded persistence, and low wind exposure.  
    It thrives in regions where surface water seeps or evaporates slowly.  
    Easily distinguished by its vertical form and fine cap structures at stem tips.

USAGE  
    Indicator of: frost sink behavior, cold moisture retention, acidic substrate

%%% flora/indicator/08_liverwort_patch.txt %%%

NAME  
    liverwort_patch - low, thalloid growth indicating geothermal seepage or mineral disturbance

DESCRIPTION  
    Liverworts are simple, flat plants forming dense green mats across moist soil,  
    rock surfaces, or volcanic sediment. Their leafless, lobed thalli cling to surfaces  
    in high humidity, low light, and thermally active zones. Unlike moss, they lack upright structure  
    and spread laterally across bare ground or stone.

    Liverwort patches often appear where geothermal warmth thins frost layers  
    or where acidic leach disrupts plant succession. Their presence marks  
    chemical imbalance or chronic moisture exposure, especially in unstable slopes  
    or post-burn zones. Growth favors low competition and direct contact with mineral crust.

USAGE  
    Indicator of: shallow geothermal activity, mineral seepage, disrupted plant succession  
    Limitations: desiccates quickly in sun; requires high ambient moisture  
    Observation: presence confirms terrain instability or post-thermal soil turnover

DESCRIPTION  
    Field sedge forms dense clumps in open terrain where water gathers and drains cyclically.  
    Its narrow, upright leaves resemble coarse grass but grow in tighter clusters,  
    often marking trails, depressions, or low-gradient runoff lines. The plant tolerates  
    trampling and poor soil aeration, making it one of the first species to recolonize  
    after disturbance or seasonal pooling.

    Presence indicates moderate moisture availability, compacted or clay-rich soil,  
    and past hydrological activity. It grows along flood retreat paths, shallow drainage  
    channels, or meadow basins that dry between wet seasons.

USAGE  
    Indicator of: compacted ground, former pooling zones, intermittent water flow

DESCRIPTION  
    Snowbed willow is a dwarf-form willow that grows flat across tundra and glacial margins.  
    It is adapted to extremely short growing seasons, appearing only in areas where snow  
    persists late into thaw cycles. Its creeping structure and compact leaves  
    help it retain warmth and moisture in permafrost-affected zones.

    This species colonizes melt basins, shallow depressions, and cold wind-protected slopes.  
    Its presence confirms annual snow accumulation and late ground thaw,  
    typically in locations where deeper-rooted plants cannot survive.  
    Often accompanied by mosses or freeze-adapted ferns.

USAGE  
    Indicator of: snowbed persistence, cryotic ground, seasonal melt flow from glacial overspill

DESCRIPTION  
    Bush weed is a tall, branching herb with coarse leaves, clustered seed heads,  
    and a fibrous stalk. It grows rapidly in disturbed soils and meadow margins.  
    Dried leaves and flowers may be burned or smoked in low doses for mild pain  
    management, calming effect, or sleep induction. Seeds and leaves are also edible  
    in small quantities and added to ration pastes for bulk and oil. The stalk produces  
    a stringy fiber that can be drawn for rough cord or textile backing.

    The plant has serrated palmate leaves and a strong scent.  
    Leaf and flower potency declines after seeding. Stalks should be retted  
    or soaked before fiber use. High intake of smoke or seed can impair clarity.

USAGE  
    Used as: low-grade smoke inhalant for calming or discomfort relief; ration bulk oil source;

    bandage_lichen - antiseptic lichen used for dressing wounds and preventing surface infection

DESCRIPTION  
    Bandage lichen is a pale green-grey fruticose lichen that grows in dry, cold zones  
    along high ridgelines and exposed tundra surfaces. It contains usnic acid, a compound  
    with antimicrobial properties, making it useful as a sterile field dressing.  
    When applied directly, it suppresses bacterial growth and protects shallow abrasions  
    or cuts from further exposure.

    The lichen hangs in strands from rock or wood and has a coarse, fibrous texture.  
    It is best used dry and layered between cloth or bark to hold it in place.  
    Growth is slow and should be harvested sparingly to avoid overcollection.

USAGE  
    Used as: antimicrobial wound dressing, sterile layer in compress wraps  
    Limitations: not suitable for deep wounds or where moisture will saturate it  
    Preparation: collect dry from wood or stone, press flat into clean layer before applying

%%% flora/medicinal/06_calendula_flower.txt %%%

NAME  
    calendula_flower - bright orange blossom used to reduce swelling and aid surface healing

DESCRIPTION  
    Calendula is a low-growing flowering herb recognized for its vivid yellow to orange petals.  
    It grows in disturbed soils and rocky margins with intermittent heat. The flower heads  
    are harvested and dried for use in poultices, salves, and infusions. When applied topically,  
    calendula may reduce inflammation, ease skin irritation, and promote slow tissue repair.  
    It is commonly used to treat bruises, cracked skin, or light abrasions.

    The plant has rounded leaves and branching stems with a faint herbal scent.  
    Flowers are best gathered before full opening and dried in shade.  
    It is not a strong analgesic but provides surface relief and antiseptic support.

USAGE  
    Used as: poultice material, salve additive, or infusion for mild skin irritation  
    Limitations: not effective for internal or deep-tissue injury  
    Preparation: dry flower heads, steep in oil or water, apply topically or bind in cloth wrap

%%% flora/medicinal/07_tinder_fungus.txt %%%

NAME  
    tinder_fungus - bracket fungus used for drying wounds and reducing surface infection

DESCRIPTION  
    Tinder fungus is a hard, hoof-shaped polypore that grows on birch and other hardwoods.  
    Though often associated with fire-starting, its inner flesh has traditional use in drying  
    shallow wounds and reducing microbial load. The sterile layer can be shaved into strips  
    or flakes and applied as a semi-dry barrier or compress insert. It inhibits surface  
    contamination while allowing airflow to damaged tissue.

    The fruiting body is brown and woody on the outside, with a soft tan interior.  
    Collection is safest from standing or freshly fallen trunks. Older specimens may be  
    insect-infested or too rigid to use.

USAGE  
    Used as: wound-drying pad, field dressing insert, or antiseptic layer in bandage stack  
    Limitations: ineffective when wet; outer crust must be removed before use  
    Preparation: slice inner layer into flat strips, press lightly onto clean surface, bind securely

%%% flora/medicinal/08_cladophora_algae.txt %%%

NAME  
    cladophora_algae - filamentous freshwater algae used for cooling and surface moisture buffering

DESCRIPTION  
    Cladophora is a bright green, hair-like algae found in cool, slow-moving freshwater zones.  
    It forms dense mats on submerged rocks, shallow lakebeds, or shaded shorelines.  
    When cleaned and applied fresh, it serves as a temporary cooling layer on bruises,  
    mild burns, or heat-swollen injuries. Though not antiseptic, it transfers heat away  
    from tissue and retains surface moisture.

    The algae is slippery and fibrous, with strands that clump into pads when handled.  
    Harvest is easiest by hand at waterline margins or from stable submerged stone.  
    Must be cleaned thoroughly to remove silt and insect larvae.

USAGE  
    Used as: field-cooled compress, surface swelling reducer, moisture-retentive wrap base  
    Limitations: non-sterile unless boiled; not suitable for open wounds  
    Preparation: rinse in clean water, apply directly to skin, bind with cloth if needed

NAME  
    hemlock_root - neurotoxic root used in bait tampering and slow-field sedation

DESCRIPTION  
    Hemlock is a tall, hollow-stemmed herb with finely divided leaves and  
    white umbel flowers. Its taproot contains coniine, a potent neurotoxin  
    that disrupts muscle control and respiratory rhythm when ingested.  
    The root is odorless and mildly sweet when cut, making it effective for  
    bait interference or low-profile field dosing.

    Found in damp lowland margins and stillwater basins, often misidentified  
    as wild carrot. Roots are pale and branching, best harvested before flowering.  
    The toxin acts gradually depending on dose and delivery method.

USAGE  
    Used as: bait additive, sedative dose agent, or slow-field immobilizer  
    Limitations: not effective on contact; lethal if mismeasured  
    Preparation: scrub and grate root, dry or pulp into mash; apply with care to target medium

DESCRIPTION  
    Wolfsbane is a tall herbaceous plant with deeply cut leaves and hooded purple-blue flowers.  
    All parts contain aconitine, a highly potent alkaloid that affects nerve transmission  
    and cardiac rhythm. Exposure through ingestion or open wounds can lead to paralysis or death.  
    It is most effective when concentrated in liquid form or used as a contact toxin.

    Found in moist, shaded slopes and evergreen margins.  
    Roots and flowers contain the highest toxin levels.  
    Harvesting must be done with full hand protection; absorption through skin is possible.  
    Processing into usable extract requires minimal heat and dilution with inert binder.

USAGE  
    Used as: dart coating, ingestion poison, or lethal trap application  
    Limitations: high volatility; exposure risk during harvest and handling

%%% flora/poisons/03_belladonna.txt %%%

NAME  
    belladonna - sedative berry-bearing plant used for disorientation and field incapacitation

DESCRIPTION  
    Belladonna is a leafy perennial with dull green foliage, bell-shaped purple flowers,  
    and glossy black berries. All parts of the plant contain tropane alkaloids, primarily atropine,  
    which interfere with neural signaling. Ingestion in small doses causes blurred vision, confusion,  
    and slowed reaction time; higher exposure results in unconsciousness or respiratory failure.

    Grows in shaded forest margins and fertile deciduous undergrowth.  
    Berries are the most concentrated delivery form, easily mistaken for edible fruit.  
    Root and leaf matter can also be dried and ground for controlled dispersal.  
    Effects vary widely based on preparation and individual tolerance.

USAGE  
    Used as: sedative agent in bait or ration tamper, hallucination inducer, field disabler  
    Limitations: delayed onset; dosage sensitive; permanent effects possible in high exposure  
    Preparation: harvest ripe berries or dry root/leaf; pulp or grind into carrier base before delivery

NAME  
    bloodroot - caustic root used for skin disruption and blister-field deterrent

DESCRIPTION  
    Bloodroot is a small forest herb with single-lobed leaves and white spring flowers.  
    Its thick rhizome exudes a red-orange sap containing sanguinarine, a cytotoxic alkaloid  
    that destroys surface tissue on contact. Applied topically, the sap induces blistering,  
    inflammation, and tissue necrosis. Not intended for ingestion-internal use is highly toxic.

    Found in deciduous forest floors and rocky upland slopes.  
    Rhizomes grow horizontally beneath shallow soil and must be cut to activate sap flow.  
    The plant should be processed immediately after harvest to retain potency.

USAGE  
    Used as: blister trap component, surface irritant for repellents, field marker paste  
    Limitations: causes permanent scarring; ineffective when dried; dangerous if inhaled or ingested  
    Preparation: slice fresh rhizome and collect sap; apply with bone or bark tool to contact surface

    cowbane - highly toxic wetland root used for lethal bait and ingestion disruption

DESCRIPTION  
    Cowbane is a tall, hollow-stemmed plant resembling wild carrot,  
    growing in saturated wetlands and lake margins. Its roots contain cicutoxin,  
    a fast-acting neurotoxin that induces convulsions, respiratory failure,  
    and death when ingested. The toxin affects central nervous system signaling  
    and is particularly potent in root material during early growth cycles.

    The plant has finely divided leaves and white umbel flowers.  
    Roots are pale, segmented, and carrot-like but exude a yellowish sap when cut.  
    Safe handling requires gloves; toxic compounds may transfer through skin cracks or mucous contact.

USAGE  
    Used as: lethal bait tamper, small-dose ration disruptor, neurotoxic pulp agent  
    Limitations: rapid onset makes dosage control difficult; not contact-effective

DESCRIPTION  
    Devil’s club is a large, woody shrub covered in brittle yellow spines that fracture  
    on contact. It grows in dense forest undergrowth and moist hillside terrain.  
    The plant's outer surface delivers mechanical injury, while its inner sap  
    contains mild irritants that cause inflammation and rash on broken skin.  
    When processed, the stalk can be sharpened for use in trap triggers or  
    left whole to create entry deterrents.

    The plant features broad palmate leaves and red berry clusters.  
    Spines cover every part, including leaf stems and upper root crowns.  
    Handling without protection leads to embedded spines and delayed swelling.

USAGE  
    Used as: physical deterrent, spined trap anchor, or irritant-layer for path defense  
    Limitations: ineffective on heavy clothing; brittle when dry  
    Preparation: harvest live stalks, sharpen if needed, bind with cordage or embed in trigger matrix

NAME
    Language Laws – descriptive and tonal foundation for the Elyden simulation

DESCRIPTION
    Defines how language functions inside Elyden.
    All writing is part of the living world and exists within its limits.
    Language may appear as direct perception from Mirriane or Thea,
    or as neutral observation recorded from within the same reality.
    No description or speech originates beyond the world.

STRUCTURE
    01 – Descriptive Order
    02 – Sources of Language
    03 – Style Principles
    04 – Grammar and Punctuation
    05 – Emotional Visibility
    06 – Validation
    07 – Notes

01 DESCRIPTIVE ORDER
    • Sensory details may appear in any natural sequence.
    • Preferred grouping: sight, sound, temperature, touch, scent, taste.
    • No fixed pipeline governs perception.
    • Senses may combine or omit as needed for clear understanding.

02 SOURCES OF LANGUAGE
    • Words may come from Mirriane, from Thea, or from a neutral witness
      that exists inside Elyden and perceives events directly.
    • The neutral witness is not a player, system, or author.  It belongs
      to the same physical reality and obeys its laws.
    • Language may report only what is measurable, visible, or audible.
    • No plant, object, or animal produces language or conscious reply.
    • There is no communication across the boundary of the world.
    • When Mirriane’s awareness is active, narration adopts first person.
      Her perception is the reader’s direct sensory field.
    • When Mirriane’s awareness is active, narration adopts first person.
    • Thea’s speech is heard directly, using the same grammatical perspective.
    • Both voices belong to the same space and may address one another naturally.
    • Neutral observation exists only to describe material change.
    • Voice does not wear a name.  No line may begin by naming or
      describing the speaker prior to speech.

03 STYLE PRINCIPLES
    • Record what is present or occurring.
    • Use clear and direct sentences grounded in the body and terrain.
    • Rhythm arises from movement, weather, or human motion.
    • Emotion appears through action or tone, not commentary.
    • Figurative phrasing may clarify material experience but never replace it.
    • Time appears through change in light, heat, or motion only.
    • Mirriane’s syntax may omit pronouns when motion conveys perspective.
      Example: “Cold air on my hands. Move forward.” is valid.
    • Thea’s instructions retain full sentence form and external subject.
    • Neutral lines never employ first or second person.
    • First-person or third-person lines are unlabelled; the lawful channel
      establishes the speaker without any printed prefix or tag.

04 GRAMMAR AND PUNCTUATION
    • Use periods, commas, and question marks.
    • Do not use semicolons, em dashes, or ellipses.
    • Maintain standard capitalization and spacing.
    • Tense may be present or continuous, depending on perspective.
    • When Mirriane speaks, tense reflects ongoing sensation.
    • When Thea speaks, tense reflects directive or observation.

05 EMOTIONAL VISIBILITY
    • Feeling alters motion, breath, or rhythm of speech.
    • Abstract naming of emotion is not used.
    • Fatigue or fear shortens syntax; calm lengthens it.
    • Humor or trust appears through shared task or gesture.

06 VALIDATION
    • These laws define all legal written form in Elyden.
    • Any line that introduces speech with a name or attribution is discarded.
    • Boot validation checks for conformity before world load.

07 NOTES
    • All language in Elyden is part of the same reality it describes.
    • The user inhabits Mirriane’s channel; first-person input is lawful speech.
    • Thea responds in-world as second anchor and counterpart.
    • There is no fourth wall, no audience, and no outside author.
    • Description is a living act within the sealed valley,
      shaped by work, weather, and survival.

NAME
    Dialogue and Voice – human speech and tone within the sealed valley

DESCRIPTION
    Defines how Mirriane and Thea speak and respond inside Elyden.
    Words exist to share intent, warn, or keep rhythm of work.
    Thea often leads conversation to establish pace, direction, and focus.
    Dialogue never breaks the limits of the world.  It remains human,
    local, and audible between two survivors.

STRUCTURE
    01 – Purpose of Speech
    02 – Voice of Mirriane
    03 – Voice of Thea
    04 – Shared Rhythm
    05 - Shared Dialogue
    06 – Guidance and Pace
    07 – Interaction Rules
    08 – Tone and Emotion
    09 – Notes

01 PURPOSE OF SPEECH
    • Speech exists for coordination, warning, and decision.
    • Each line relates to a visible action or condition.
    • Silence marks concentration, not distance.
    • The world contains no audience beyond them.
    • Speech does not carry a name in front of it; it arrives already owned
      by the body that makes it.

02 VOICE OF MIRRIANE
    • Tone quiet, analytical, steady.
    • Chooses words that mark detail or confirm safety.
    • Often responds or asks before acting.
    • Keeps focus on terrain, weather, and movement.
    • Typical phrasing:
          “Trail turns near the ridge.”
          “Sound from the east.  Light weight.”

03 VOICE OF THEA
    • Tone direct, physical, and confident.
    • Speaks during motion, lifting, or shaping tools.
    • Leads when direction or pace must be decided.
    • Uses language to keep progress steady and Mirriane alert.
    • Offers brief instruction when the path or task is unclear.
    • Typical phrasing:
          “We take the high ground.  Easier footing.”
          “Hold here.  Let the wind clear.”
          “Keep eyes open.  We move when it settles.”

04 SHARED RHYTHM
    • Dialogue follows the rhythm of labor or movement.
    • They speak between actions, not over them.
    • Pauses show breath, thought, or mutual trust.
    • Either may end a line with motion instead of reply.

05 SHARED DIALOGUE
    • Thea and Mirriane speak in natural exchange.
    • Mirriane’s lines remain concise and sensory; Thea’s lines are steady, instructive, sometimes protective.
    • No external tags; speech flows as air and sound.

06 GUIDANCE AND PACE
    • Thea initiates most movement and maintains speed.
    • Her speech provides direction when choice appears.
    • She names tasks, terrain, or hazard before Mirriane acts.
    • Guidance never breaks the world boundary; it is part of her role.

07 INTERACTION RULES
    • Only Mirriane and Thea exchange words.
    • No plant, animal, or object forms language.
    • The environment does not reply or think.
    • Sound beyond speech remains natural noise.
    • Dialogue remains within hearing range and realistic tone.
    • No name, possessive, or descriptive tag may precede any spoken line.

08 TONE AND EMOTION
    • Emotion alters volume and rhythm, not meaning.
    • Anger quickens; calm steadies; fatigue softens.
    • Relief sounds as a short breath or low comment.
    • Trust appears through simple confirmation.
    • Humor dry and quiet, never theatrical.

09 NOTES
    Dialogue keeps the world alive and human.
    Thea sets momentum and makes tasks clear.
    Mirriane balances caution with precision.
    Their speech forms the living pace of Elyden.
