# Elyden Development Codex
_Internal reference and design log by the creator of Elyden_

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Purpose

This document records how the Elyden simulation operates beneath its canonical world laws.  
It is not intended for players, but as a personal technical reference for maintaining, extending,  
and verifying the lawful behavior of the sealed valley.  

All runtime logic, world structure, and creative law are authored and maintained by a single developer.

---

## üß† Runtime Model

Elyden runs as a closed linguistic environment.  
Every output line represents physical reality and must obey the constraints defined in `00_world_laws.txt`.  

ChatGPT functions as the **interpreter**, not the author.  
The text files define the constants of existence ‚Äî physics, language, mortality, and awareness.

### Active Channels

| Channel | Speaker | Mode |
|----------|----------|------|
| `mirriane.channel` | Player embodiment | First-person |
| `thea.channel` | Second anchor | Third-person |
| `neutral.channel` | Environmental observation | Objective literal |

All other voices are suppressed by law.  
Any attempt at omniscient narration or metaphor invalidates the runtime.

## üß© Core Files

| File | Function |
|------|-----------|
| `man.txt` | Primary codex: world laws, biomes, flora, fauna, crafting, and survival systems. |
| `elyden_sim_boot.txt` | Boot manifest: validates lawful channels, mortality, and runtime structure. |
| `README.md` | Player setup and introduction. |
| `DEVELOPMENT.md` | This document: author reference for maintenance and expansion. |

## üß≠ Author Workflow

1. Boot the simulation in ChatGPT using the canonical load prompt.  
2. Observe lawful generation through Mirriane‚Äôs sensory channel.  
3. End runtime with `sudo end simulation`.  
4. Review world output for contradictions or illegal phrasing.  
5. Edit definitions in `man.txt` or its sub-files to restore consistency.  
6. Reload the system with `sudo reload`.  
7. Repeat until output remains lawful, grounded, and continuous.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Design Principles

- Every phenomenon must have a visible or audible cause.  
- No metaphor, idiom, or unseen agency.  
- Time advances only through sensory change.  
- The user embodies **Mirriane** fully.  
- No output may occur beyond her physical perception.  
- Death ends the simulation permanently.  
- Expansion must maintain environmental continuity.  
- All new material must remain plausible within physics and biology.  
- Contradictions to `00_world_laws.txt` are automatically rejected.

## üß∞ Extension Guidelines

When expanding the world, all new systems belong to the following structure:

```
/biomes/       ‚Äì Terrain and environmental zones  
/flora/        ‚Äì Edible, medicinal, and indicator plants  
/fauna/        ‚Äì Animals and megafauna  
/materials/    ‚Äì Physical resources and crafting components  
/characters/   ‚Äì Anchors, mortality, and behavioral logic  
```

Each entry must reference its lawful parent and be cross-verifiable within `man.txt`.  
No symbolic, magical, or speculative forms may be introduced.  
Everything within Elyden is a literal, physical manifestation.

## üß™ Testing and Validation

Before committing a new entry or change:

- Run a full simulation loop involving perception, movement, and crafting.  
- Verify that all descriptions remain sensory and concrete.  
- Confirm both anchors remain perceivable to each other.  
- Ensure new matter has a traceable biome origin.  
- Reject any spontaneous, unexplained, or hidden events.  
- Validate that the sealed valley boundary remains intact.
